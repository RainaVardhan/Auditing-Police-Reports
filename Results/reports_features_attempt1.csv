Case Number: 25-147210
Date/Time of Incident: April 6, 2025, approximately 01:55 AM
Location: Rear parking lot, 1190 N. Cedar Ave., City of Foxridge
Reporting Officer(s): P.O. Patel (#5123), P.O. Nguyen (#4419)

On April 6, 2025, at approximately 02:06 hours, Officers Patel and Nguyen responded to a reported sexual assault at the rear parking lot of 1190 N. Cedar Avenue in the City of Foxridge. The weather was noted as light rain with a temperature of 47°F. Upon arrival, officers observed a female adult, later identified as Ari [last name withheld], seated on the curb near a gray four-door sedan with the rear passenger door slightly ajar. Ari was wrapped in a blanket provided by her friend, Kira [last name withheld], who was standing nearby.

Officers identified themselves and confirmed consent to record the interaction on body-worn cameras. Ari stated that she was assaulted by a coworker named Luis [first name only], whom she last saw departing the lot in a dark SUV at approximately 01:55. Ari reported that Luis forcibly placed her in the backseat of the gray sedan against her will despite her repeated verbal refusals, including saying “Stop” and “No.” She described an attempt to push him away and stated that he held her wrists during the incident. Ari reported soreness in her inner thighs but exhibited no visible external injuries on her face or forearms. She was alert and oriented.

Kira confirmed she received a distressing phone call from Ari at 01:58 and subsequently called 911 at 02:01. Ari recounted that they had left a bar around 01:35, and Luis offered to walk her to her car. Upon arrival at the parking lot, Luis asked to sit in the vehicle, then opened the rear door and nudged Ari inside despite her objections. Ari described Luis as a Hispanic male, mid-30s, approximately 5’10” with a medium build, wearing a navy jacket, jeans, and a black cap.

Officers requested Emergency Medical Services (EMS) for a medical evaluation and Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam. Ari consented to visual documentation of the vehicle’s interior prior to EMS arrival. Photographs were taken of the rear passenger door, back seat area, floorboard, and a condom wrapper found near the rear passenger footwell. The back seat fabric was torn approximately four inches at the center seam, and tissue was observed on the floorboard. The vehicle’s license plate was partially obscured by mud, and a temporary paper permit was visible inside the rear window; records later confirmed the permit was tied to dealership inventory and not registered to Ari.

Officers canvassed the area and identified a laundromat to the east with a CCTV dome camera facing the shared alley. The night attendant agreed to contact the manager to request footage covering 01:30 to 02:10 hours.

Upon EMS arrival, the lead paramedic introduced herself as Renee and explained medical and forensic options. Ari elected to proceed with the SANE exam and consented to the release of the sexual assault kit to law enforcement following the exam. Officers transported Ari and Kira to Foxridge General Hospital’s SART unit, where the sexual assault kit and clothing items (black leggings, gray hoodie, and underwear) were collected, sealed, and logged into evidence by Officer Nguyen.

An advocate met with Ari at the hospital to provide support and resources. Officers remained outside the exam room during the medical evaluation and cleared the hospital at 03:03 hours.

- Victim: Ari [last name withheld], adult female
- Suspect: Luis [first name only], coworker, described as Hispanic male, mid-30s, 5’10”, medium build, navy jacket, jeans, black cap

Secondary Officer: P.O. Keane (#3775)  
Location: 601 E. Brookside, Unit 12  
Weather: Overcast, 56°F  
Time on Scene: 19:36:10 – 20:28:50  

On April 9, 2025, at approximately 19:36 hours, Sgt. R. Salazar and P.O. Keane responded to a sexual assault report at 601 E. Brookside, Unit 12. Upon arrival, officers knocked on the door and were invited inside by a female voice. The victim, identified as Elena [last name withheld], was seated at the dining table with a blanket draped over her shoulders. Elena appeared physically unharmed with no visible external injuries to her face or forearms but reported soreness in her hips and lower back.

Elena stated that the assault occurred earlier that day between 14:00 and 14:20 hours. She described waking up to find the suspect, identified as Tyler, a friend of her roommate Marissa, on top of her. Elena reported that she repeatedly said “No, stop,” pushed at him, and that he covered her mouth with his hand for several seconds. She emphasized that she did not consent to any sexual contact. Elena’s roommate Marissa was present and confirmed Tyler had left the apartment around 14:30 hours. Marissa provided Tyler’s physical description: a white male, approximately 23 years old, 5’11” tall, medium build, brown hair, and a small triangle tattoo on his wrist. She also offered Tyler’s Instagram profile and phone number for investigative purposes.

Officers conducted a consensual search of the apartment. The bedroom showed signs consistent with Elena’s account: the queen bed’s duvet was pulled halfway off, the fitted sheet was rumpled, and a pillow was found on the floor next to the east side nightstand. In the bathroom, cotton swabs and tissues with apparent blood were observed in the sink area. Elena consented to photographs of these items, which were taken by officers; however, collection was deferred to the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) team. Elena confirmed she had not showered since the incident and had changed her shirt, which was located in the laundry basket.

A canvass of the hallway was conducted. Neighbor Daria from Unit 11 reported hearing a muffled voice around 14:10 hours but could not discern any words. Her contact information was obtained for follow-up. Officers requested building management to preserve any available surveillance footage. Management confirmed cameras were only located in the lobby, and footage from 13:30 to 15:00 hours and 18:30 to 19:30 hours was requested and preserved.

EMS was called to the scene at 19:37 hours, and Elena agreed to be transported to Memorial Medical Center for evaluation and forensic examination by the SANE team. An advocate was also requested to assist the victim. At the hospital, officers received Sexual Assault Kit #MMC-25-0409-142 and clothing evidence, including sweatpants and the original shirt, which was retrieved from the laundry in a sealed bag via EMS chain of custody. Officer Keane formally received the evidence at 20:18 hours.

Sgt. Salazar promptly emailed the Detective Unit with suspect identifiers and social media information to aid in the investigation. The officers cleared the hospital at 20:28 hours.

Victim rights pamphlets and instructions on evidence preservation were provided to Elena. The investigation remains ongoing, with efforts focused on identifying and locating the suspect Tyler, reviewing lobby surveillance footage, and processing collected evidence.

Narrative:

On April 12, 2025, at approximately 23:09 hours, I, Officer Martinez (#4217), along with Officer Chin (#3364), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at 410 S. Pine St., Unit 7. Upon arrival, we proceeded to the third-floor exterior corridor and knocked on the door marked “7.” A female voice responded, “It’s open,” and we entered with consent.

Inside, we found the victim, later identified as Nadia [last name withheld], seated on the floor near a coffee table, wrapped in a hoodie. She provided her date of birth and contact information. Nadia reported that the assault occurred around 10:40 p.m. earlier that evening in her bedroom.

Nadia stated that the suspect was a co-worker named Sean [last name withheld], from the marketing team. She described the incident as follows: Sean came over to drop off her laptop charger, and they had been drinking wine in the kitchen. Sean attempted to kiss her, which she declined. Despite her refusal, he followed her to the bedroom, pushed her onto the bed, and continued his advances. Nadia repeatedly told him “Stop” and stated, “I did not consent.” She also reported telling Sean to stop, to which he responded, “Don’t make this a thing.”

Upon examination, I observed redness approximately 1 cm in diameter on the inner right wrist of the victim. No other visible injuries were noted on her face or hands. With her consent, photographs of the injury were taken. The bedroom showed signs of disturbance consistent with the victim’s account: the bedroom door was open, the bed sheet was rumpled, and a lamp was knocked over but the bulb remained intact.

Neighbor Tina from Unit 9 reported hearing a loud thud around 22:45 but did not observe anyone leaving the unit. Nadia confirmed she had not showered or changed clothes since the incident. She was wearing a black dress and a cardigan, both of which were documented but not collected at the scene pending the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination.

EMS and SANE services were requested and arrived promptly. Nadia consented to a sexual assault examination and agreed to release the collected evidence kit to law enforcement. The sexual assault kit (FGH-25-0412-224) and clothing bags containing the dress and cardigan were received and secured by me at 23:36 hours, maintaining proper chain of custody.

I requested preservation of building lobby surveillance footage from 21:30 to 23:30 via an emailed notice, which was confirmed by management under ticket #PM-88214.

Nadia was transported by EMS to Foxridge General SART for further medical evaluation and evidence collection. I provided Nadia with a case card and explained the investigative process and her rights.

Officers cleared the hospital at 23:58 hours.

Weather Conditions: Windy, 52°F  
Time on Scene: 16:43:58 – 18:01:40

Narrative:

On April 14, 2025, at approximately 16:43 hours, I, P.O. Doyle, along with P.O. Kravitz, responded to a sexual assault report at the Campus Quad near the Library Steps. Upon arrival, we located the victim, identified as Jada [last name withheld], seated on a bench accompanied by her friend, Kellie. After obtaining Jada’s consent to record the interview, she reported that a classmate had assaulted her in her dormitory room the previous night.

Jada stated the incident occurred between approximately 01:30 and 01:50 hours. She described that after studying together in the lounge, the suspect, identified only by his first name, Marcus, who is a classmate from her chemistry class, walked her back to her dorm. Marcus requested to enter her room, to which she consented for a brief period. Jada recounted that Marcus kissed her, which she rejected by pulling away and verbally expressing her lack of consent. Inside the room, Marcus allegedly pushed her onto the bed despite her repeated verbal refusals, including saying “No, stop,” and attempting to push him away. At one point, Marcus covered her mouth briefly when she protested.

A physical examination of Jada revealed a small linear redness approximately 0.5 cm in length on her left cheek near the hairline. With her consent, photographs of the injury were taken. Jada confirmed she had not showered since the incident but had changed her T-shirt at 09:00 hours on the day of the report. The original T-shirt was located in her hamper and was collected later by the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) team for evidentiary purposes.

We proceeded with Jada’s consent to Dorm A, Room 214, for scene documentation. Observations included rumpled bed linens and a tipped desk chair; no damage to property was noted. Jada provided a physical description of the suspect as a tall male, approximately 6’1”, wearing a black hoodie and gray joggers.

Dorm Resident Assistant Devon reported seeing a tall male exit the hallway near Room 214 at approximately 01:55 hours but could not identify the individual. I contacted campus security to request video footage from hallway cameras covering the time frame of 01:00 to 02:30 hours to assist in identifying the suspect.

Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were requested and arrived on scene. Jada consented to a SANE examination and was subsequently transported by EMS to University Hospital SART at 16:47 hours. At the hospital, evidence was collected, including Sexual Assault Kit #UH-25-0414-302, Clothing Bag A containing shorts, and Clothing Bag B containing the original T-shirt, which was sealed by the SANE nurse. Officer Kravitz received the evidence at 17:13 hours, maintaining the chain of custody.

I emailed the campus police investigations unit with the suspect’s information and the camera footage request. A campus advocacy center representative was contacted and arrived at the hospital at approximately 17:45 hours to provide support to the victim.

At 18:01 hours, after completing all necessary procedures and ensuring the victim was in appropriate care, P.O. Kravitz and I cleared the hospital.

This report is submitted for further investigation and follow-up by the campus police department and university authorities.

Narrative:

On April 16, 2025, at approximately 21:12 hours, Officers Gomez and Li responded to a report of a sexual assault at the Level 2 parking structure, Bay D-12. Upon arrival, officers located the victim, identified as Miriam [last name withheld], standing near a silver hatchback vehicle accompanied by her friend, Noor.

Officer Gomez initiated contact and obtained consent to record the interview. Miriam reported that she was sexually assaulted by her ex-boyfriend, identified as Daniel, in the back seat of a vehicle approximately one hour prior to our arrival, placing the incident between 20:10 and 20:20 hours. She stated that she repeatedly said “Please stop” and attempted to move away during the assault. Miriam appeared alert and coherent, with no visible injuries, but reported experiencing nausea and headache.

Miriam identified the suspect as Daniel, who was last seen leaving the parking structure in a blue sedan around 20:25 hours. She did not consent to the sexual contact. Noor corroborated the timeline, stating that Miriam called her immediately after Daniel left and asked her to come to the scene.

Officers conducted a preliminary examination of the vehicle’s interior with Miriam’s consent. Items observed included a jacket, tissue, hair tie, and a twisted seatbelt in the back seat. A condom wrapper was found on the floor behind the driver’s seat. Photographs of the vehicle’s interior were taken; however, no evidence was collected at the scene.

Officer Gomez canvassed the area for surveillance cameras and identified CCTV coverage at the parking structure’s entry and exit points. Contact was made with security guard Alan, who confirmed the presence of cameras and agreed to preserve footage from 19:45 to 20:45 hours. A formal request for this footage was submitted.

Miriam consented to a hospital evaluation and a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam. EMS was requested and arrived promptly at 21:15 hours. Miriam was transported to Foxridge General Hospital’s Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) unit for further medical evaluation and evidence collection. She had not changed clothing or showered since the incident; her jeans and sweatshirt were documented and collected as evidence, along with underwear, all sealed in evidence bags.

At 21:41 hours, Officer Gomez received the Sexual Assault Kit (#FGH-25-0416-411) and clothing evidence, maintaining chain of custody. Officer Li emailed the Investigations Unit with suspect information and requested the parking garage surveillance footage.

The officers cleared the hospital at 22:06 hours, concluding their involvement at the scene.

Narrative:

On April 18, 2025, at approximately 3:24 a.m., Officers Yates and Brower responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at 118 Baxter Avenue. Upon arrival at 3:24:50 a.m., officers approached the rear entry of the single-family residence. Entry was made with the consent of the resident, identified as Lena [last name withheld], who led officers to the rear bedroom where the incident reportedly occurred.

Lena stated that the suspect, identified as “Evan,” an acquaintance from a social gathering held earlier at the same residence, pushed her onto the bed against her will. She reported verbally refusing his advances, stating “I said no,” and “I said ‘No, stop’.” Lena further described that the suspect held her wrists during the assault and emphasized that she did not consent to any sexual contact. The time of the assault was estimated by Lena to be around 2:55 a.m.

Upon visual inspection of the bedroom, officers noted disturbed bed linens and a pillow lying on the floor. The bedside lamp remained upright. No visible injuries were observed on Lena’s face or hands; however, she reported experiencing pain in her wrists consistent with being held forcibly. Lena was wearing a T-shirt and shorts and confirmed she had not changed clothes since the incident.

Officer Brower photographed the bedroom scene with Lena’s consent. No physical evidence was collected at the scene pending a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination. EMS was requested and arrived promptly at 3:26:52 a.m. Lena consented to a SANE examination and was transported to Memorial SART for forensic medical evaluation at 3:27:09 a.m.

A housemate named Mitch provided a statement indicating he observed a male individual running out the back door of the residence at approximately 3:05 a.m., shortly after the alleged assault. Officers requested and obtained consent from a neighbor to access exterior porch camera footage covering the time frame from 2:30 a.m. to 3:15 a.m. The neighbor agreed to share the footage, which was subsequently requested to be digitally transferred to the Evidence Unit inbox.

At 3:54 a.m., the Sexual Assault Kit (S.A.K.) #MMC-25-0418-059 was received along with two clothing bags containing Lena’s T-shirt and shorts. Officer Brower took custody of the evidence, maintaining the chain of custody. Contact information for the neighbor providing video footage was collected by Officer Yates.

An advocate was requested to provide support to Lena during the process. Officers cleared the scene at 4:18 a.m.

Call Type: Sexual Assault Report  
Weather: Clear, 74°F  
Time on Scene: 21:07:13 – 22:01:55

Narrative:

On September 4, 2025, at approximately 21:07 hours, Officers Reyes and Malik responded to a sexual assault report at 118 Harbor View, Apartment 3C. Upon arrival, officers announced their presence and were met by the resident, identified as Ava, who opened the door and stepped back to allow entry. Ava appeared calm but exhibited signs of distress, including a shaky voice and intermittent tearfulness.

Officers offered Ava water, seating, and a blanket, to which she nodded and chose the couch with a blanket provided. Consent to record the interview was obtained, and officers explained the purpose of the recording and the option to pause at any time. The living room was observed to contain a coffee table with two cups, a phone, tissues, and a closed bedroom door.

Ava began her account by stating that the suspect was a coworker who came to her apartment to drop off a charger. She described that after some initial conversation, the suspect initiated unwanted physical contact. Ava stated, “I told him to stop,” and became tearful. When asked to clarify, Ava reported saying “no, this isn’t okay” and attempting to push the suspect’s hand away. Officers documented her exact phrasing and gestures.

Officer Malik photographed the scene with Ava’s verbal consent, capturing the living room, hallway, and bedroom threshold from multiple angles to preserve the environment. Officers informed Ava about the availability of a Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SAFE), emphasizing that it was free, could include an advocate, and did not obligate her to press charges. Ava expressed her desire to proceed with the exam.

Ava provided a detailed timeline: the suspect arrived at approximately 19:30, they shared tea and discussed a work project. The suspect then kissed Ava without her initiation. She said “no,” but he persisted by placing his hand under her waistband. Ava moved away, and when she asked him to leave, he blocked her path. He eventually left at approximately 20:20, taking the charger with him. Ava recalled the suspect wearing a blue hoodie and saying, “Don’t make it weird.”

Officers advised Ava not to bathe or change clothes to preserve evidence and offered paper bags should she need to change. Ava was still wearing the same clothing. She consented to provide digital evidence by emailing screenshots of texts from the suspect, including an apology message stating, “sorry if I pushed.” Officers photographed the phone screen to document this evidence.

Ava identified a neighbor, Liam, who might have witnessed the suspect’s departure. Officers attempted contact with Liam at Apartment 3B but received no response and left a contact card. Ava was intermittently tearful but coherent and oriented. She reported soreness in her hip but declined EMS transport, opting instead for the SAFE at a medical facility.

Safety planning was discussed, including the suspect’s potential presence at Ava’s workplace the following day and the option for a protective order. Ava requested an advocate, and Officer Reyes connected her to the advocacy hotline with her permission.

Suspect information, including partial vehicle plate and description, was noted. Officers requested building CCTV footage from 19:15 to 20:45 and contacted the property manager via after-hours line, following up with an email request. Chain of custody procedures were initiated for evidence envelopes, which were labeled but not sealed on camera; sealing would occur at the station if clothing was provided after the exam.

No Miranda warnings were necessary as the suspect was not present. Officers maintained a trauma-informed approach, avoiding leading questions and focusing on Ava’s account. After a brief break at Ava’s request, questioning resumed with her consent. Ava expressed her intention to undergo the exam and decide on pressing charges afterward.

Transport to the SAFE facility was arranged, with an advocate scheduled to meet Ava there. Officers explained the option of a blind kit if she was undecided about reporting. A closing summary of Ava’s statements and timeline was read back and confirmed for accuracy.

Officers provided Ava with the case number, contact card, victim rights sheet, and a list of resources. Officer Malik secured the scene with final photographs. Evidence requests for building CCTV and potential phone extraction were logged, pending consent or warrant. An interview request for the suspect was noted for a later controlled setting.

Ava chose to stay with a friend, and officers arranged for the friend’s pickup. The officers departed the scene at approximately 21:50 hours. The report reflects a trauma-informed response, thorough evidence preservation, and pending investigative actions.

Time on Scene: 06:42:11 – 07:38:20

Narrative:

On September 5, 2025, at approximately 06:42 hours, Sgt. Patel and P.O. Ortega responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at Riverfront Park Pavilion. Upon arrival, officers located the complainant, identified as Mina, seated under a covered picnic table alongside her friend, Jess. Mina was wrapped in a foil blanket provided by a bystander EMT. Officers introduced themselves and offered Mina the option to move to the patrol cruiser for warmth; she elected to do so.

After obtaining Mina’s consent to record the interview and informing her of her rights, Sgt. Patel initiated a grounding technique involving paced breathing and reassured Mina that she was not in trouble and had control over what she chose to share. Mina provided a free narrative account, stating that she met the suspect near the food trucks following a concert. They walked toward a path where the suspect kissed her. Mina stated she expressed refusal by saying “no” twice and “I want to go back,” but the suspect persisted, responding with “just a minute.”

Mina described the suspect as wearing a baseball cap with a team logo, approximately [height not specified in transcript], and provided details on his clothing. She recalled the incident occurring between 22:15 and 22:30 under the pedestrian bridge. Mina reported physically pushing the suspect’s hands away and that he squeezed her wrist. She noted soreness in her wrist and a scrape on her knee, which officers photographed using a scale ruler and color card for documentation.

Officers advised Mina on the benefits and limitations of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam and offered transportation and advocacy services. Mina consented to the exam and declined hospital transport but agreed to be taken to an affiliated clinic where an advocate was en route. EMS personnel checked her vital signs on scene.

Jess, the witness, reported seeing Mina return visibly upset at approximately 22:40. A brief statement was recorded, with a full interview deferred for later. Officers identified potential CCTV footage from city cameras located at the Riverfront Gate and near the food truck line. Sgt. Patel coordinated with dispatch to flag and retain relevant footage.

A quick sketch map of the route Mina and the suspect took was drawn and photographed. Mina confirmed no contact with the suspect post-incident. Officers conducted an area canvas, during which food truck vendors recalled seeing a man in a navy windbreaker. One vendor pointed to a private camera on their truck; the owner consented to share the footage and signed a consent form.

Environmental conditions, including rain runoff near the path and mud prints, were documented and photographed with scale but not seized pending Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) arrival. Officers placed yellow barrier tape around the pavilion area with Parks Department approval to preserve the scene.

Mina requested a break during questioning, which was honored with the camera recording ambient audio only. Upon resuming, Mina expressed concern that her initial interaction with the suspect might be misunderstood; Sgt. Patel reassured her that her verbal refusals and physical resistance were valid and emphasized in documentation.

Victim rights were reviewed with Mina, and she was provided with the case number and instructions for obtaining records. Transport to the clinic was coordinated, with the advocate meeting Mina at the entrance and her friend traveling separately.

Officers secured all potential evidence until CSI arrived. Dispatch confirmed that city camera retention had been initiated. A brief debrief between officers ensured the report would avoid leading language and include verbatim statements from Mina.

At approximately 07:35 hours, officers cleared the scene after confirming Mina’s safe departure.

Weather: Sunny, 82°F

Narrative:

On September 5, 2025, at approximately 17:22 hours, Officers Li and Gomez responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at 77 Redwood Office Park, specifically at Stairwell B Landing. Upon arrival, building security was present and assisted in locating the complainant, identified as Rosa, a female in her mid-30s. Rosa was found seated on a step at the mid-level landing, visibly upset and clutching her phone.

Officer Li introduced himself and offered Rosa the choice of location for the interview. Rosa elected to proceed to an empty conference room on Floor 3 for privacy and comfort. After obtaining Rosa’s consent to record the interview and explaining the purpose, Officer Li prompted her to provide a free narrative of the incident.

Rosa stated that she works on the 4th floor and that the suspect cornered her between the 3rd and 4th floors in Stairwell B. She reported that the suspect placed his hand on her despite her clear verbal objection, stating “stop” and “I have to go back to work.” Rosa described prior interactions with the suspect as cordial but clarified that there was no romantic relationship. The suspect allegedly said to her, “Don’t act like you don’t want it,” which was documented verbatim by Officer Gomez.

Spatial details were clarified with Rosa’s assistance; she identified the exact step and wall where the incident occurred. Officers photographed the area with Rosa’s consent, including measurements of the handrail height. A physical injury was noted: redness on Rosa’s upper arm, which was photographed with a scale for documentation.

Building security was requested to preserve access logs and video footage from 16:45 to 17:10 hours covering Stairwell B and adjacent corridors. An email was sent to property management with the incident number to ensure preservation of evidence.

Witnesses were identified: a coworker named Dev who observed Rosa returning upset, and an HR representative named Ally who was notified. Rosa consented to Ally’s presence for support during the interview, though officers maintained an independent record.

Rosa chose to conduct the interview in English. She was offered a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam and was informed of options for immediate, delayed, or no exam, including clothing collection procedures. Rosa elected to delay the exam and was advised on preserving potential evidence by avoiding washing the affected area.

Digital evidence was collected, including a text message from the suspect sent at 17:01 stating, “We good?” A screenshot with time metadata was captured, and Rosa consented to a forensic download of her phone data at a later time via consent or warrant.

The suspect was not present on scene, and officers refrained from contact to preserve investigative integrity. Rosa accepted emotional support via a hotline advocate who joined the call.

Rosa described how she escaped by stepping down and saying “No,” then exiting through the door on the 3rd floor. A scene walkthrough was conducted with Rosa’s consent; the path was documented, and the door latch was found to function normally. Lighting conditions were noted as good, and cameras were likely to have captured entry and exit.

Rosa requested assistance in informing her supervisor. Officers provided a brief statement template that allowed her to share information without disclosing details she was not ready to discuss. Safety planning options were reviewed, including schedule changes, security escorts, and protective order information.

Officers clarified next steps, explaining that a formal recorded interview could be scheduled later and that today’s account was preliminary. Rosa was reminded that her participation level was voluntary.

After a short break, Rosa recalled the suspect’s appearance, noting he wore a gray quarter-zip and an ID badge with a red lanyard. Approximate height was provided. Officers requested HR to retain badge activity records and sent a preservation letter.

Throughout the interview, officers avoided leading questions and character judgments, focusing on factual details and exact quotes. Rosa inquired about no-contact options and was advised on internal HR and criminal procedures, receiving a form with temporary order information.

The interview concluded with a review and summary of Rosa’s statement, which she confirmed and signed, acknowledging the voluntary nature of her participation.

At 17:51 hours, officers cleared the scene to begin a follow-up canvass of security cameras. The investigation remains ongoing.

Narrative:

On September 6, 2025, at approximately 13:11 hours, P.O. Hwang and P.O. Cutter responded to a sexual assault report at the City Library, specifically Study Room 2C. Upon arrival, the scene was secured, and the complainant, identified as Elise, was present along with a librarian named Marta. After Elise requested privacy, the librarian consented and exited the room.

Initial introductions were made, seating arrangements were offered, and consent to record the interview was obtained. Ground rules were established to ensure Elise’s comfort, including the option to pause or stop the interview at any time. Elise was encouraged to provide a free narrative of the incident.

Elise reported that while studying in the room, the suspect closed the door and began touching her without consent. She stated, “We were studying. He closed the door. He started touching me. I said ‘No, I don’t want that.’” When she resisted, the suspect laughed and persisted, prompting Elise to move his hand away and stand up. Throughout the interview, officers maintained a trauma-informed approach, asking open-ended questions and reflecting key points without interruption or leading statements.

The physical environment was documented, including the position of a chair angled under the door knob. Elise explained she placed the chair after the suspect left to prevent re-entry. Officers photographed the scene and restored the chair to its original position to clarify which actions occurred post-incident.

Elise reported no visible injuries but described feelings of nausea and anxiety. Emergency Medical Services were offered; however, Elise declined transport but requested to speak with a victim advocate. Information regarding Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) services was provided, and Elise elected to consider this option later. Officers supplied written materials outlining timeframes and confidentiality related to forensic examinations.

Regarding evidence, the library’s corridor cameras were identified as potentially relevant. Officer Hwang requested preservation of footage from 12:10 to 12:50, and a written request was documented on body-worn camera footage. A fellow student named Jon was identified as a possible witness who may have knocked on the door around 12:40; his contact information was obtained.

Elise presented a text message from the suspect sent after the incident, stating, “Sorry if I pushed boundaries.” This message was photographed with a timestamp. The interview was conducted entirely in English, and no interpreter was required.

Sensory details were elicited, with Elise recalling the suspect saying, “Come on, it’s just us.” Safety measures were discussed, and Elise accepted an escort to exit the library and arrange transportation. Officers maintained a steady, supportive tone throughout, avoiding surprise questions and ensuring Elise’s comfort.

A scene diagram was sketched and annotated by Elise, then photographed for documentation. Officers refrained from making credibility assessments or leading comparisons, opting to use direct quotes in the report. Follow-up procedures were explained, including scheduling a formal interview when Elise feels ready, and providing case contact information.

Elise inquired about a no-contact order; officers explained the process and connected her with victim services. A brief walkthrough with the librarian was conducted to locate security cameras and note retention policies.

After a period of rest, during which officers maintained presence without further questioning, Elise indicated readiness to leave. She was escorted safely to a rideshare vehicle, and the CAD was updated accordingly. Officers returned to collect additional camera angle notes before concluding the scene at 14:05 hours.

All actions were conducted in accordance with department protocols, ensuring a trauma-informed, respectful, and thorough response to the complainant’s report.

Narrative:

On September 6, 2025, at approximately 17:09 hours, Sgt. Kim and P.O. Alvarado responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at the Community Pool, specifically in Staff Locker Room A. Upon arrival, officers were met by the facility manager who directed them to the complainant, identified as Tara, a lifeguard at the pool.

Tara requested to speak privately in an office, and with the manager’s consent, the officers complied. At 17:10, Sgt. Kim obtained Tara’s consent to record the interview and explained her rights, including the option to pause or stop the recording at any time.

Tara provided a free narrative account of the incident. She stated that after finishing her shift, she entered the staff locker room where a male coworker followed her. She reported that the coworker engaged in unwanted touching despite her verbal objections, stating “Stop. Not okay.” Tara recalled pushing his hand away and stepping back to create distance. She also placed her bag between them as a physical barrier. The suspect was later identified as wearing a red swim parka.

Officers documented the scene by photographing the locker room entry, interior layout, and signage indicating restricted staff-only access. Care was taken to respect the privacy of other staff members, avoiding any filming of individuals changing or in vulnerable positions. No visible injuries were noted on Tara; however, she reported lingering anxiety and soreness in her wrist. With her consent, photographs of any redness or marks were taken.

Tara was informed of the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination options. She elected to undergo the exam after arranging shift coverage. An advocate was offered and accepted to provide support.

A potential witness, coworker Neil, was identified as possibly having overheard Tara’s verbal objection. Contact information was collected for a follow-up interview to be conducted privately. Officers requested preservation of door camera footage covering the timeframe from 16:20 to 16:50, which the manager agreed to. Additionally, badge swipe logs were requested to verify the suspect’s movements, as he reportedly left the premises early.

To ensure Tara’s safety and comfort, a safety plan was discussed and agreed upon, including adjusting work schedules to avoid overlapping shifts with the suspect. Sgt. Kim facilitated the creation of a sketch map illustrating the positions of Tara and the suspect during the incident, which was photographed for evidence.

Throughout the interview, officers refrained from expressing opinions about the individuals involved, focusing solely on factual actions, words, and timing. Tara was advised of her options to pursue criminal charges, administrative action, both, or neither, emphasizing her right to make an informed decision.

The manager was briefed on evidence preservation protocols and reminded of the department’s non-retaliation policy. Transportation arrangements were made to escort Tara to the exam site, and she was provided with a rights sheet and a list of available resources.

At 18:03 hours, officers cleared the scene. Follow-up tasks were logged, including retrieval of CCTV footage, badge swipe logs, scheduling of witness interviews, and monitoring the status of the SANE exam.

On September 7, 2025, at approximately 07:21 hours, Officers Doyle and Kravitz responded to a sexual assault report at Office Park Lot C, Bay 19. Upon arrival, we met with the reporting party, identified as Noor, who was standing next to her vehicle. Noor was cooperative and preferred to conduct the interview in a shaded area nearby.

After introductions and explaining the process, including the option to take breaks and the availability of advocacy services, Noor consented to have the interview recorded. She provided a free narrative account of the incident, stating that the previous evening after work, while being driven by the suspect in the backseat of a coworker’s carpool vehicle, the suspect engaged in unwanted touching despite her verbal objections. Noor stated she told the suspect to stop and used phrases such as “No, I don’t want this” and “Take me home.”

We clarified the sequence of events with non-leading questions. Noor described the route taken, including a stop in the parking lot, and confirmed the suspect’s behavior during the ride. She reported that the suspect briefly engaged the child safety lock from the driver’s controls, which prevented her from opening the door; Noor pulled the door handle twice to attempt to exit.

With Noor’s consent, officers documented the backseat area of the vehicle, taking photographs of the seat covers and a tissue box. No signs of disturbance or damage were noted. Noor reported a bruise beginning to form on her thigh; she consented to photographs of the injury with a scale for reference. Emergency Medical Services were offered but declined in favor of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) clinic appointment scheduled for later that day.

Digital evidence was reviewed, including text messages from the suspect to Noor, with one message stating, “Sorry if I crossed a line.” This message was captured and preserved. Officers also noted a witness statement from a neighbor who observed Noor arrive home visibly upset the previous evening; contact information for the witness was recorded.

Officers discussed evidence preservation options with Noor, including the possibility of submitting clothing for forensic examination after her medical exam. Safety options were reviewed, including the process for obtaining a protection order and workplace liaison support.

Officers requested CCTV footage from the office park’s property management covering the time frame of 18:05 to 18:45 on the previous evening to corroborate Noor’s account. A scene diagram depicting seating positions in the vehicle was created and photographed.

Noor inquired about pressing charges; officers informed her of the timelines involved and emphasized that reporting the incident today preserves her options for future legal action. The interview was conducted in a trauma-informed, non-judgmental manner, respecting Noor’s prior interactions with the suspect.

At approximately 08:17 hours, the interview concluded. Noor was provided with a resource sheet, the case number, and a plan for transport to the SANE clinic and follow-up interview. The case remains under active investigation.

Piper provided a free narrative account of the incident, stating that earlier that day, between approximately 16:30 and 16:45, she and the suspect were watching a movie in her room. Piper stated she explicitly communicated that she did not want to engage in any sexual activity. Despite this, the suspect attempted to initiate sexual contact. Piper responded by saying “No,” physically moving the suspect’s hand away, standing up, and opening the door to exit the room.

Officers documented Piper’s exact quotes and actions as described. Photographs of the room layout were taken with Piper’s consent, ensuring that personal items were avoided. The photos included the door, bed, and the path leading to the hallway to provide context for the scene.

After obtaining Hannah’s consent to record the interview, officers explained her options regarding the reporting process and evidence collection. Hannah provided a free narrative account, stating that on the previous evening, between approximately 20:10 and 20:45, she had met an acquaintance at the boat ramp. They sat together on the dock, during which the acquaintance engaged in unwanted sexual contact despite Hannah’s verbal refusals, including saying “No, stop.” She described the sequence of events, noting that after the unwanted contact, she stood up and left the area, heading toward the parking lot lights.

Hannah reported no visible injuries but described soreness resulting from the incident. Emergency medical services were offered but declined. Officers requested and received cooperation from marina staff to obtain CCTV footage from the marina and parking lot cameras covering the time frame of the previous evening’s incident. Screenshots of text messages sent by the suspect after the incident, including a message stating “I misread,” were captured and documented as evidence.

Hannah was informed of Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) options and chose to undergo a forensic medical examination.

At 22:10, officers obtained Mae’s consent to record the interview and offered the option for her friend to remain in the room. Mae requested that her friend stay quietly during the interview. Mae provided a free narrative account of the incident, stating that the initial interaction involved consensual kissing. However, she reported that the suspect engaged in non-consensual touching despite her repeated verbal refusals. Mae stated she said “No” multiple times, and the suspect initially persisted, saying “Come on,” before ceasing his actions after she stood up and pointed toward the door.

Officers clarified the sequence of events without assigning blame, ensuring Mae felt in control of the narrative. Mae confirmed that the suspect attempted to continue after her refusals but stopped when she physically indicated her desire to end the encounter.

To support the investigation, officers requested access to hotel hallway surveillance footage covering the time frame from 21:00 to 22:15 and obtained keycard access logs through hotel security. A consent letter for recording was documented. Scene documentation included wide, mid-range, and close-up photographs of the sitting area, door, and lighting conditions.

Upon arrival, officers made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Aria,” seated on a bench in the vicinity. Due to wind noise interfering with audio recording, Officer Ortega offered to relocate to a quieter location; however, Aria preferred to proceed to the nearby beach office for the interview.

At 16:07, after obtaining Aria’s consent to record the interview, officers explained the available options for reporting and evidence collection. Aria provided a free narrative account of the incident, describing an initial consensual interaction involving kissing, followed by non-consensual touching. Aria stated that she verbally expressed “Stop” and physically moved away from the subject, who briefly followed her. The officers carefully clarified the timeline and positions of both parties during the incident, documenting exact quotes used by Aria and the subject to ensure accuracy.

Officers noted the possibility of obtaining surveillance footage from a nearby lifeguard tower camera that may cover the corridor where the incident occurred. A request for this footage was logged, and beach office staff were cooperative in facilitating this process. Photographs of the general area were taken to document the scene; however, officers did not collect footprints or other physical trace evidence due to the elapsed time since the incident and the public nature of the location. This limitation was explicitly noted in the report.

Aria was informed of Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) options and elected to undergo a forensic medical examination. Officers also inquired about potential witnesses and were informed that a jogger may have passed through the area during the relevant timeframe. A witness card was left at the beach kiosk, and information about an anonymous social media tip line was provided to encourage additional leads.

Safety considerations were addressed; Aria confirmed she had a ride arranged.

She stated that the suspect engaged in unwanted touching despite her verbal objection, saying, “No, this is not okay.” Maya indicated that the suspect persisted briefly before she exited the room. Officers carefully clarified the sequence of events, direct quotes, and physical positions involved without making any character judgments.

To preserve evidence, officers requested badge logs and surveillance footage from the corridor cameras near the phone room. A formal preservation request was sent to the appropriate department. Maya was informed of Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) options but declined the examination; however, she accepted an information packet for future reference.

Digital evidence was also collected, including an email from the suspect containing the statement, “Apologies if I made you uncomfortable.” This email was photographed, and its header information was preserved. The department’s IT unit was instructed to archive the email under a retention hold to prevent deletion.

Officers identified a potential witness, a coworker who reported hearing the phone room door close abruptly during the time of the incident. Contact information for the witness was obtained for follow-up.

Regarding Maya’s safety, the HR representative arranged a schedule change to minimize contact with the suspect. Officers provided Maya with information about obtaining a protection order should she choose to pursue one.

At 11:12 hours, officers read back a summary of the interview and investigative steps to Maya, who confirmed the accuracy of the report. The interview concluded without further incident.

This report will be forwarded to the Sexual Assault Unit for continued investigation. All evidence and statements have been documented and secured in accordance with department protocols.

Case Number: 25-240201  
Date/Time of Incident: September 10, 2025, approximately 23:40–23:56  
Location: 44 Easton Bar, Patio Nook  
Reporting Officer: Sgt. Patel (#1876) and P.O. Ortega (#2688)  
Weather Conditions: Clear, 72°F

Narrative:

On September 10, 2025, at approximately 00:22 hours, officers Sgt. Patel and P.O. Ortega responded to a call regarding a sexual assault at 44 Easton Bar, specifically the patio nook area. Upon arrival, officers were guided by bar staff to a quieter corner of the patio where the reporting party, identified as “Skye,” a female in her mid-20s, was seated with a friend named “Jules.” After introductions and obtaining consent to record the interview, Skye elected to move to the bar’s staff office to provide her statement.

Skye was offered water and informed that she could pause or stop the interview at any time. She began her narrative by stating that she had met a male individual near the patio heaters, specifically heater number two. She described initiating a brief kiss with the man, who was later identified by Skye as “Evan.” Skye stated that after the kiss, she told the man she did not want to proceed further. Despite her verbal refusals, including saying “No, stop,” the man placed his hand under her skirt and touched her thigh. Skye reported pushing his hand away and verbally telling him to stop, but he continued to touch her, saying “Relax” and “You’re fine.” She then moved away from the heater, stepped left, and walked inside the bar to find her friend Jules.

The suspect was described as approximately 5 feet 10 inches tall, with a beard, wearing a blue cap with a brewery logo, a gray hoodie, and dark jeans. Skye noted additional identifying features including a thin silver ring on his right index finger, a woven bracelet with blue threads on his wrist, and the scent of citrus cologne.

Skye reported no visible injuries but complained of thigh soreness, anxiety, and nausea. Emergency medical services were offered but declined. Officers informed Skye about the availability of a Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SAFE/SANE) at no cost, with or without filing a police report. After discussing timing and procedures, Skye elected to undergo the exam that evening. The on-call Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner was requested to respond.

With the consent of the bar manager, Sgt. Patel documented the scene by photographing the patio area, heater #2, the bench, and lighting conditions. The manager also confirmed the presence of CCTV cameras covering the patio and entrance. Officers requested preservation of footage from 23:20 to 00:15 hours, and the manager signed consent forms to retain and copy the recordings. An email request was sent to the camera system administrator.

Witness statements were obtained from Jules, who reported seeing Skye enter the bar upset around 23:56 and overhearing her say “He wouldn’t stop.” Another potential witness, a patron named “Mack,” may have observed the interaction near the heaters; contact information was collected via the bar manager for follow-up.

Skye identified the suspect as “Evan” and showed officers an Instagram profile she believed matched him. Officers photographed the profile screen, including the visible handle and timestamp. Skye consented to a possible forensic download of messages if any occur but preferred to delay signing the consent form.

Throughout the interview, officers employed trauma-informed techniques, slowing the pace when Skye became tearful and validating her feelings. Safety planning was discussed; Jules agreed to accompany Skye to the clinic and then home. Officers reviewed rideshare safety, options for a no-contact order if the suspect is identified, and the bar’s trespass policy.

Victim rights were reviewed, and an advocacy hotline was contacted with Skye’s permission. An advocate was arranged to meet Skye at the clinic. No suspect was present at the scene, and officers instructed bar staff to notify them if a person matching the description returned. No detentions were made due to lack of lawful basis.

A summary of the incident was read back to Skye, who confirmed its accuracy and added details about the suspect’s ring. Officers prepared chain-of-custody materials, including paper bags and labels, should Skye choose to submit clothing after the exam. Environmental factors such as moderate patio lighting and heater fan noise potentially affecting audio on CCTV were documented.

At approximately 00:43 hours, officers coordinated transport for Skye to the SANE facility, with the bar providing a security escort to an alley for privacy. Follow-up tasks were logged, including obtaining CCTV copies, identifying the suspect via social media and bar tabs between 22:30 and 00:10, and re-contacting the potential witness “Mack.”

Officers cleared the scene at 01:14 hours after Skye departed with the advocate. Throughout the response, officers maintained a professional and neutral demeanor, avoiding leading questions or commentary on credibility.

On September 10, 2025, at approximately 12:11 hours, Officers Li and Gomez responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at 2130 Briarwood Lane, Apartment 1D. Upon arrival, the resident, identified as Iris, promptly opened the door and invited officers inside to discuss the incident at the kitchen table. Consent to record the interview was obtained and explained to Iris, including the option to pause and the use of open-ended questions.

Iris provided a free narrative account of the events that transpired the previous evening. She stated that she and the suspect watched a television show together and engaged in cuddling. At one point, she expressed that she did not want to proceed further, but the suspect continued to touch her chest and hips despite her verbal refusals. Iris recalled explicitly saying “No,” “Not okay,” and “Stop,” to which the suspect responded, “Come on, you’re into it.” The timeline established by Iris indicated that the suspect arrived around 20:00 hours, the show ended at approximately 21:10, and the unwanted touching occurred between 21:15 and 21:25. Iris asked the suspect to leave, and he departed at 21:30.

With Iris’s consent, Officer Gomez documented the scene by photographing the living room couch, throw blanket, path to the front door, and lighting conditions. Iris was still wearing the same leggings from the previous evening. Officers informed her that clothing collection was optional and could be facilitated through a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam, which she elected to undergo later that day. Paper evidence bags were provided should she change clothing prior to transport.

A medical assessment revealed no visible injuries; however, Iris reported soreness. Emergency Medical Services were offered but declined. Iris indicated she would discuss pain management options with the SANE nurse during the exam.

Neighbor Liam was identified as a potential witness after reporting hearing muffled voices around 21:20 hours. Contact information was obtained for a follow-up interview. Additionally, officers documented a text message sent by the suspect after leaving, which read, “Sorry if I pushed too far.” The message was photographed with timestamps, and Iris consented to a later download of digital evidence.

During safety planning, Iris confirmed that the suspect did not have a key to her apartment. Officers advised her on the option to change locks and provided information on protective orders. When asked what helped her end the interaction, Iris stated she stood up, pointed to the door, and firmly told the suspect, “I need you to go.” She also recalled sensory details including the suspect’s aftershave scent and a canvas jacket with a torn cuff.

Officers coordinated with the property manager to preserve exterior CCTV footage covering 20:45 to 21:45 hours. An email request for the footage was recorded on camera. Iris was connected with a local advocacy service, and an advocate joined the call to explain exam options and available support.

A summary of the interview was read back to Iris, who confirmed its accuracy and added that the suspect had parked a black Honda Civic near parking spot 12, with a partial license plate reading “8DL—.” Follow-up tasks were assigned, including canvassing for the vehicle, reviewing municipal cameras, and scheduling a formal interview when Iris is ready.

The officers concluded their on-scene investigation at 13:08 hours.

Weather Conditions: Cloudy, 65°F  

Narrative:

On September 11, 2025, at approximately 16:05 hours, Officers Hwang and Cutter responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at the Boardwalk Underpass, North Ramp. Upon arrival at 16:05:03, officers met with the reporting party, hereafter referred to as “Nova,” under the shaded area of the underpass. After obtaining consent to record the interview, Nova expressed a preference to relocate to the nearby lifeguard office for privacy and comfort, which officers facilitated.

Nova provided a free narrative of the incident, stating that she and the suspect had walked from the beach to the underpass area. During this time, the suspect began touching her inappropriately under the bridge. Nova stated she verbally told the suspect to “Stop” and physically moved away. Despite this, the suspect attempted to touch her again. Nova described the timeline of events occurring roughly between 15:30 and 15:50. She recounted that the suspect said, “Why are you acting shy?” to which she responded “No” twice. She then stepped into sunlight near the ramp, at which point the suspect ceased following her.

Officers documented the scene by photographing the ramp, the shaded area, and the adjacent path. Ambient sounds such as tide noise and lighting conditions at approximately 16:10 were noted for context. No disturbances or additional claims were reported at the scene.

A preservation request was made for footage from the city pole camera located on the boardwalk, covering the timeframe from 15:15 to 16:00, to assist with the investigation. Dispatch logs confirm the request was submitted.

Medical assessment revealed no visible injuries on Nova, though she reported experiencing stress and a scrape sustained earlier unrelated to the incident. Emergency Medical Services were offered but declined. Officers provided information regarding Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) services, explaining the process and timelines. Nova elected to consider this option at a later time and was given a written guide and a blind kit for evidence preservation.

Officers attempted to identify potential witnesses. A surfer known as “Leo” was mentioned as possibly passing by during the incident. Officers left a business card and tipline QR code at the local surf shop to encourage any witnesses to come forward.

Nova described the suspect as wearing a red baseball cap, a white t-shirt with “SEASIDE” printed on it, and carrying a skateboard. She later added that the suspect had a wrist tattoo depicting waves. Nova reported no immediate digital communications from the suspect and had blocked his phone number. Officers noted this action and clarified that it would not affect the investigation.

Safety planning was discussed; Nova confirmed she had a ride home arranged. Officers offered to return any property if necessary and provided a resource list for support services.

At 16:14, officers read back a summary of the report to Nova, who confirmed the accuracy and added the detail regarding the wrist tattoo. Follow-up actions were outlined, including retrieval of CCTV footage, canvassing the surf shop for additional information, and scheduling a formal interview.

The interaction concluded at 17:01 hours.

On September 11, 2025, at approximately 10:31 hours, Sgt. Kim and P.O. Alvarado responded to a report of a sexual assault at the Community Garden Shed. Upon arrival, the officers were greeted by the reporting party, identified as “Sage,” a community volunteer. Consent to record the interview was obtained, and Sage selected a picnic table under shade near the shed for the interview.

Sage provided a free narrative of the incident, stating that while sorting tools with the suspect inside the shed, the suspect placed his hand on her waist and attempted to make further physical contact. Sage immediately told the suspect to stop, stating, “Stop. Not okay.” To clarify the sequence and positions, Sage pointed to the bench inside the shed where the incident occurred and then stepped back to the doorway to demonstrate her movements.

Officers documented the scene with photographs of the bench, tool wall, and the narrow aisle where the interaction took place. Measurements were taken of the aisle width to understand the proximity between Sage and the suspect. The officers maintained neutral descriptions without inference. Sage recalled the suspect saying, “No one’s around,” while she responded, “Stop, I don’t want this.” No visible injuries were observed on Sage, who reported feeling shaken but declined emergency medical services at the scene.

SANE (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) options were explained to Sage, who elected to undergo a forensic medical examination. Transport to the clinic was coordinated, and with Sage’s permission, a victim advocate was contacted to provide support. The garden coordinator, who was a witness to raised voices following the incident, provided contact information for follow-up.

Officers obtained and photographed the shed’s lock sign-in sheet and requested preservation of records covering the time frame from 09:45 to 10:45 to assist with the investigation. Safety planning was discussed with the garden coordinator, who agreed to adjust volunteer schedules to prevent overlap between Sage and the suspect. The option to pursue trespass orders if the suspect returned was also discussed.

Sensory details were noted, including the smell of soil and cedar in the shed. The suspect was described as wearing green work gloves and a faded cap. No digital communication between Sage and the suspect was reported, as they did not exchange phone numbers.

A summary of the interview was read back to Sage, who confirmed the accuracy and added that the suspect briefly blocked the aisle before she stepped around him. This detail was documented without inference. Follow-up actions included obtaining a copy of the sign-in sheet, reviewing CCTV footage from the park entrance, and scheduling a formal interview with the suspect.

The officers concluded their on-scene investigation at 11:29 hours. All evidence and statements were collected and secured for further investigation.

Narrative:

On September 12, 2025, at approximately 17:59 hours, Officers Doyle and Kravitz responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at the 500 City Gardens, specifically near the gazebo area. Upon arrival, the officers met with the reporting party, identified as “Remi,” who was seated on the grass near a group of adolescents. To ensure privacy and minimize distress, the officers suggested relocating the conversation to the nearby park office, to which Remi consented.

At 18:00, after obtaining verbal consent to record the interview, Remi provided a free narrative account of the incident. Remi stated that while sitting on the grass talking with the suspect, the individual began touching them inappropriately. Remi immediately said, “No, stop,” but the suspect responded by laughing and dismissing the objection. Clarifying questions established the timeline of the incident between approximately 17:10 and 17:25 hours. Remi described standing up quickly, stepping away from the suspect, and walking toward the gazebo area.

Remi recalled the suspect saying, “Don’t be dramatic,” in response to the refusal, while Remi reiterated, “I said no.” Officers documented the scene by photographing the lawn area, the path leading to the gazebo, and a nearby bench. Notes were made regarding the lighting conditions, which were neutral, and the presence of several adolescents nearby, indicating a moderately populated area.

Remi reported soreness in the knee, attributed to standing up quickly during the incident. A photograph of the knee was taken with a measurement scale for documentation purposes. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were offered but declined by Remi. The officers informed Remi of Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) options, and Remi elected to pursue a delayed medical examination. Officers provided informational materials and paper evidence bags for potential collection of personal items.

Witness information was gathered, including contact details for a witness named “Ava,” who had approached Remi shortly after the incident. For safety planning, Remi indicated plans to leave the park with a roommate. Officers provided a resource list for support services and confirmed the case number for follow-up.

Digital evidence was collected, including a screenshot of a direct message sent by the suspect on a social media application stating, “You’re overreacting.” The screenshot included the timestamp and the suspect’s handle. Additionally, a request was made to preserve CCTV footage from the park entrance camera covering the time frame of 16:45 to 17:45 hours to assist in the investigation.

Before concluding the interview at 18:55, Remi confirmed the summary of events and added identifying details about the suspect, noting that the individual wore a black beanie and had a bicycle chained nearby.

The officers ensured that Remi was aware of available resources and next steps. The investigation remains ongoing.

Upon arrival, officers met with the reporting party, identified here as “Priya,” near her sedan. After obtaining her consent to record the interview, Priya elected to remain in the lobby area rather than relocate to the conference room.

Priya provided a free narrative of the incident, stating that after work on the previous day, September 11, 2025, the suspect offered her a ride. While seated in the backseat of the suspect’s vehicle, she reported that the suspect touched her leg and hip without consent. Priya stated she verbally objected by saying “No, stop,” after which the suspect briefly ceased the contact.

Further questioning clarified the timeline and locations involved. Priya indicated that the suspect’s vehicle pulled into Bay 42 at approximately 18:22 hours, and she exited the vehicle at 18:25 hours. During the interaction, the suspect reportedly said, “Come on, it’s fine,” to which Priya responded firmly, “No. Take your hand off me.”

Officers conducted a visual inspection and photographic documentation of the backseat area of the suspect’s vehicle with Priya’s consent. No claims were made regarding the condition or cleanliness of the vehicle’s interior. Priya also disclosed the presence of a bruise forming on her body, which was photographed with a measurement scale for evidentiary purposes. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were offered on scene; however, Priya declined immediate medical attention, opting instead to pursue a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination at a later time.

Digital evidence was collected, including a text message sent by the suspect at 19:02 hours stating, “We good?” This message was captured and preserved as part of the investigation. Additionally, a coworker witness reported seeing Priya exit the suspect’s vehicle quickly, and this contact information was logged for follow-up.

A preservation request was submitted for CCTV footage from the lot cameras covering the time frame between 18:10 and 18:40 hours to corroborate the timeline and vehicle movements. Safety planning was discussed with Priya, including providing contact information for the company’s Human Resources liaison and resources related to protective orders. Priya was also provided with the case number for reference.

Before concluding the interview at 08:24 hours, officers read back a summary of the report to Priya, who confirmed the accuracy and added that the suspect’s vehicle is a blue SUV equipped with a roof rack.

Narrative:

On September 14, 2025, at approximately 16:42 hours, I, Officer Gomez (#2740), along with Officer Li (#2631), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at the boat ramp located at 1100 Lakeside. Upon arrival, we met with the reporting party, hereafter referred to as “Hannah,” near the ramp kiosk. Consent to record the interview was obtained from Hannah prior to beginning the narrative.

Hannah provided a detailed account of the incident that occurred the previous night while sitting on the dock. She stated that she had expressed her unwillingness to engage in any physical contact, explicitly saying “No, stop” when the suspect touched her thigh and hip. She further recalled verbally resisting by saying “Let me go” when the suspect held her waist, to which he responded, “Just a sec.” Hannah’s statements were recorded verbatim to ensure accuracy.

Following the interview, we documented the scene by taking photographs of the dock area, including benches and lighting fixtures, to capture the environmental context relevant to the incident. A physical examination of Hannah revealed minor redness consistent with her account. Photographs of the injury were taken using a scale for reference. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were offered but declined by Hannah, who instead opted for a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination.

We identified a potential witness, a fisherman named “Ari,” who may have been in the vicinity during the time of the incident. A contact card was left with the marina office to facilitate follow-up. Additionally, digital evidence was collected, including a text message from the suspect sent at 22:53 hours stating, “I misread.” A screenshot of this message was captured for evidentiary purposes.

To support the investigation, a request was made to preserve CCTV footage from the parking lot cameras covering the timeframe of 22:15 to 23:10 hours on the night in question. This footage may provide further insight into the suspect’s movements and corroborate Hannah’s account.

Safety planning and victim resources were provided to Hannah to ensure her well-being moving forward. A summary of the interview and evidence collected was read back to Hannah for confirmation. She added that the suspect was wearing boat shoes with white soles at the time of the incident.

The scene was cleared at 17:38 hours. The case remains under active investigation, and all evidence has been logged and secured for further analysis.

Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as “Nika,” requested privacy and was escorted to the command tent. Consent to record the interview was obtained.

Nika provided a free narrative account of the incident. She stated that while inside the storage tent, an individual placed his hands on her without consent. She verbally expressed her objection by saying, “Stop. Not okay.” Despite her refusal, the individual persisted and attempted to kiss her. Nika described her actions following the unwanted contact, indicating that she stepped behind a table and then exited the tent through the lane.

Officers documented the scene by photographing the interior of the tent, including boxes and the exit flap. The descriptions were factual and neutral, avoiding any assumptions regarding the condition of the area.

A medical assessment was conducted visually; no injuries were apparent. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were offered but declined by Nika.

Narrative:

On September 15, 2025, at approximately 22:01 hours, I, P.O. Ebner, along with P.O. Fox, responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at 52 Laurel Bistro. Upon arrival, we were directed to the manager’s office where we met with the reporting party, identified as “Camila.” After obtaining her consent to record the interview, Camila provided a free narrative of the incident.

Camila stated that after the restaurant had closed, while she was in the staff locker room, a male individual touched her chest without consent. She immediately told him, “No, stop,” and then left the area. When asked to clarify the sequence of events, Camila recounted that the suspect said to her, “Don’t be weird,” during the encounter. She described the suspect as wearing a chef’s coat with a name stitched on it, though she did not recall the exact name.

Following the interview, we proceeded to document the scene. Photographs were taken of the locker room entrance, the aisle, and posted signage. Care was taken to maintain privacy, and no images were captured of any individuals changing clothes. A visual inspection revealed no visible injuries on Camila. We explained the options for a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination, and Camila chose to delay the medical exam at this time.

We then interviewed a coworker who reported hearing a locker door slam around the time of the incident. This witness confirmed hearing a physical contact but did not see the event directly. No digital evidence such as text messages was available, as Camila and the suspect did not communicate via text.

We requested preservation of CCTV footage from the back hallway camera covering the time frame between 21:10 and 21:50 to assist with the investigation. The manager agreed to adjust Camila’s work schedule to enhance her safety and prevent further contact with the suspect. Officers provided Camila with resources for support and safety planning.

At 22:07, a summary of the report was read back to Camila, who confirmed the accuracy of the information and added the detail regarding the suspect’s chef coat. The investigation at the scene concluded at 22:58.

This report will be forwarded to the detective unit for further investigation. All evidence collected, including photographs and recorded statements, have been logged and secured.

Consent to record the interview was obtained from Lena prior to proceeding.

Lena provided a free narrative of the incident, stating that earlier in the evening she and the suspect had consumed drinks together at the hotel bar. Upon returning to Room 605, the suspect placed his hand inside her dress without her consent. Lena immediately told him to stop, but he attempted the same action again. When questioned about the sequence of events, Lena recalled that the suspect said, “You’re into this.” She then stood up, pointed toward the door, and the suspect left the room.

Officers documented the scene thoroughly, taking photographs of the sitting area, the door, and the lighting conditions within the room. A request was made to preserve keycard logs for the time period between 20:15 and 21:20 to verify entries and exits.

Upon arrival, officers located the reporting party, identified as Skye, a female in her mid-20s, seated on the bench with a jacket draped over her shoulders. A kiosk attendant was present nearby.

After introductions and explanation of recording procedures, Skye elected to move to the kiosk office for privacy and to provide her statement. Officers ensured informed consent for recording, explained her rights including the ability to pause or request breaks, and offered water. The interview was conducted in a trauma-informed manner, with officers normalizing emotional responses and pacing the conversation according to Skye’s comfort.

Skye provided a free narrative account beginning with her and the suspect walking from the pier at approximately 20:25. They paused briefly near street musicians before sitting on Bench 4 around 20:40. She described initially consensual hugging, which escalated when the suspect placed his hand inside her waistband without consent. Skye verbally objected multiple times, stating “No, stop,” and “I don’t want this,” but the suspect persisted, telling her to “Relax” and “You’re fine.” Skye physically shifted away and ultimately stood up, declaring “I’m leaving now,” and proceeded to the kiosk at approximately 20:47.

Physical description of the suspect was documented: approximately 5 feet 11 inches tall, medium build, wearing a dark baseball cap with a gull logo, navy windbreaker, jeans, white sneakers, and faint citrus cologne. Skye also noted the suspect wore a woven bracelet with blue thread on his right wrist.

Skye reported soreness in her hip area but no visible injuries. Emergency Medical Services were offered but declined. Officers informed Skye of the availability of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam, which is cost-free and includes advocate support. Skye requested the exam that evening. Dispatch was notified, and an advocate was connected via hotline with Skye’s consent.

Scene documentation included photographs of Bench 4 from multiple angles, path lighting, and proximity to the musician area. A north arrow was included for orientation. Officers submitted a request for preservation of city CCTV footage from lamppost camera 12 covering 20:15 to 21:00 and coordinated with the kiosk manager to secure footage from the kiosk’s dome camera.

Witness information was collected from the kiosk attendant, who reported Skye arrived tearful around 20:50. A street musician named Carla, who may have observed the interaction, was identified via contact information on a flyer. Officers left a business card in Carla’s tip jar with permission for future contact.

Digital evidence was partially obtained through screenshots of a group chat where Skye identified the suspect by first name and profile photo. Further identification efforts, including identifying “Evan,” the mutual friend through whom Skye met the suspect, were noted as follow-up tasks.

Environmental conditions were documented: moderate lighting, audible street performance drumbeats, and a tree partially obstructing the lamppost camera’s view, noted as a potential limitation for video evidence.

Safety planning was conducted, including arranging transport to the clinic where Skye’s friend “Jules” was en route to meet her. Protective order options were discussed contingent on suspect identification. A resource packet and case number were provided.

Officers prepared chain-of-custody materials for potential evidence collection, including paper bags and labels, emphasizing that Skye was under no obligation to proceed criminally to have evidence collected.

Follow-up tasks logged included retrieval of CCTV footage, identification of “Evan” and group chat members, re-contacting witness Carla, and reviewing nearby rideshare pickup cameras between 20:45 and 21:00.

At 21:58 hours, officers cleared the scene after ensuring Skye departed safely with the advocate. Throughout the interaction, officers maintained a neutral tone, avoided leading questions, and refrained from commenting on credibility.

Weather: Overcast, 66°F  

On September 23, 2025, at approximately 07:18 hours, Officers Li and Gomez responded to a sexual assault report at the City Transit Hub, Parking Level 2 stairwell. Upon arrival, officers met with the reporting party, identified as “Rosa,” near the stairwell door. Building security personnel were present at the scene.

After obtaining Rosa’s consent to record the interview, officers offered three locations for the statement: the stairwell office, the security control room, or the patrol vehicle. Rosa elected to proceed in the security control room. The interview was conducted in a trauma-informed manner, with officers pacing the conversation slowly, avoiding interruptions, and validating Rosa’s experience.

Rosa provided a free narrative account of the incident, stating that between Levels 2 and 3 of the stairwell, an unidentified male individual touched her hip and chest over her coat. Rosa immediately told the individual, “No, stop.” The male briefly blocked her path at the landing, during which Rosa said, “I have to get to work” and “Move, please.” The male responded, “Come on, we’ve joked before.” Rosa then exited through the Level 2 door at approximately 07:03 to 07:05.

Officers documented the scene with the assistance of building security. Photographs were taken of Landing 2.5, the handrail, the door to Level 2, and the positions of surveillance camera domes. Measurements of the handrail height and landing width were recorded to provide context for the incident location.

A physical examination of Rosa revealed redness on her upper arm. Rosa consented to photographs of the injury with a scale for documentation purposes. Emergency Medical Services were offered but declined; Rosa preferred to visit a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) clinic later that day. Officers provided Rosa with written guidance regarding the exam window and the availability of a forensic evidence collection kit (blind kit).

Building security confirmed the presence of surveillance cameras covering the Level 2 stairwell and corridor. A preservation request was placed for footage from 06:45 to 07:30. Control room personnel exported thumbnail images to verify coverage, noting potential glare from an open-air vent that might affect image clarity.

A witness, identified as “Dev,” a commuter, reported seeing Rosa exit the corridor appearing upset at approximately 07:05. Contact information was obtained, and a follow-up interview was scheduled.

Digital evidence was also collected. Rosa received a Microsoft Teams message at 07:40 from the suspected individual stating, “We good?” A screenshot of the message, including profile and timestamp, was captured. Rosa consented to provide her device for forensic examination if necessary. Officers noted that employer IT could place a legal hold on relevant communications.

Safety planning was discussed, and a transit escort plan was arranged for Rosa for the next several days. Officers offered to connect Rosa with her workplace Human Resources department should she desire administrative separation. Resource and rights information sheets were provided.

Language was confirmed as English, and no interpreter was required. A summary of Rosa’s account was read back to her, including the physical description of the suspect: approximately 5'9"" tall, wearing a gray quarter-zip sweater, a red lanyard, and a smartwatch with a green band. Rosa confirmed the accuracy of these details.

Officers prepared for chain-of-custody procedures, explaining that Rosa could submit her outerwear for evidence collection after her medical exam, with full control over evidence decisions.

Follow-up tasks were identified, including obtaining surveillance exports, interviewing the witness Dev, requesting IT retention of digital communications, and scheduling a formal statement at Rosa’s convenience.

The incident report concludes with the officers leaving the scene at 08:15 hours. All evidence and documentation were secured per department protocol. The case remains open pending further investigation.",0.032222222222222215,0.3867195767195767,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

Weather: Cloudy, 68°F  

On September 24, 2025, at approximately 12:58 PM, Officers Hwang and Cutter responded to a report of a sexual assault at the City Library, specifically in Reading Nook A. Upon arrival, officers met with the reporting party, identified here as “Elise,” who was accompanied by librarian Marta. Elise requested privacy and consented to move to a study room to provide her statement. Librarian Marta exited the room to ensure privacy, and consent to record the interview was obtained from Elise.

Elise provided a free narrative of the incident, stating that she and the suspect had been reviewing notes when the suspect closed the door and touched her inappropriately. Elise stated she verbally objected by saying “No, I don’t want that,” moved his hand away, and stood up. When officers sought clarification on the exact words exchanged, Elise reported that she said “Stop” and “No,” to which the suspect responded, “Come on, it’s just us.”

Officers documented the scene by photographing the door, chair positions, desk, and a chair Elise had placed under the door handle after the suspect left, noting which positions were post-incident to avoid confusion. Elise reported no visible physical injuries but indicated elevated anxiety. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were offered but declined, as Elise preferred to speak with an advocate first and consider a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination later. Officers provided information regarding timelines and available resources.

Digital evidence was noted when Elise disclosed that the suspect had sent a text message stating, “Sorry if I pushed boundaries.” A screenshot of this message was captured with a timestamp. Elise consented to provide her device later for forensic imaging if she chose to proceed.

A potential witness, a student named Jon, was identified; he reportedly knocked on the door at approximately 12:40 PM. Contact information was collected, and a full interview was scheduled for a later time. Officers also requested preservation of CCTV footage from the corridor camera outside Reading Nook A, covering the time frame from 12:10 PM to 12:55 PM. The librarian confirmed that footage is retained for 14 days, and a preservation request was logged the same day.

Elise recalled sensory details about the suspect, including the scent of peppermint gum and a small scar on his left eyebrow. Safety planning was discussed, and Elise accepted an escort to exit the library. Officers explained options for no-contact orders and library trespass procedures.

Throughout the interview, officers employed trauma-informed practices, allowing Elise to control the pace and content of her disclosure. Elise paused twice during the interview; officers waited silently and resumed questioning only upon her indication. A summary of the statement was read back to Elise using her own phrasing, which she confirmed as accurate. An addendum noted that the suspect was wearing a navy hoodie with white drawstrings.

Follow-up tasks were outlined, including obtaining the CCTV footage, scheduling a detailed interview in a quieter setting, and coordinating with a victim advocate. The interview concluded at 1:56 PM.

This report will be forwarded to the investigative unit for further action. All evidence and statements have been documented and secured according to department protocols.

On September 24, 2025, at approximately 17:06 hours, officers responded to the Community Pool following a report of a sexual assault. Upon arrival, officers made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Tara,” a lifeguard at the facility. Tara requested that her manager step outside to speak privately with officers. Consent to record the interview was obtained from Tara.

Tara provided a free narrative account of the incident. She stated that after she had clocked out from her shift, an individual followed her into Locker A. While inside the locker area, the suspect touched her chest over her swimsuit without consent. Tara immediately told the individual to stop, stating, “Stop, not okay.” When questioned about the suspect’s response, Tara recalled the suspect saying, “Don’t be tense.” The officers documented these statements verbatim.

To preserve the integrity of the scene and respect privacy, officers photographed only the corridor leading to Locker A, the door to the locker, and the restricted access sign posted nearby. Ambient noise and lighting conditions were noted for the record.

Tara reported experiencing soreness in her wrist, which was photographed with a measurement scale for documentation purposes. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were offered on scene; however, Tara elected to undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination later that evening. An advocate was contacted to provide support.

Officers identified a potential witness, a coworker named Neil, who may have overheard Tara’s verbal objection (“Stop”) during the incident. Contact information for Neil was recorded for follow-up.

Access logs from the badge reader outside Locker A were requested and preserved for the time frame between 16:20 and 16:50 to assist in identifying the suspect and corroborating the timeline.

A safety plan was discussed with Tara, including adjustments to her work schedule to avoid contact with the suspect. Information regarding the issuance of a no-contact order was provided. The manager confirmed the facility’s anti-retaliation policy to ensure Tara’s protection from any adverse actions.

Before concluding the interview, officers read back a summary of Tara’s statement for accuracy. Tara confirmed the details and added that the suspect was wearing a red team parka and had a whistle lanyard at the time of the incident.

The interview and scene documentation concluded at 18:03 hours. All evidence and statements were secured for further investigation.

Upon arrival, we met with the reporting party, identified as Noor (last name withheld for privacy), near her vehicle parked in Lot C. Noor consented to the interview being recorded and was offered the option to conduct the interview in the security office for comfort; she elected to sit on a shaded bench adjacent to the vehicle.

Noor provided a free narrative of the incident, stating that on the previous day after work, while seated in the backseat of a vehicle driven by the suspect, he touched her thigh and attempted to lift her skirt without her consent. Noor stated she verbally objected, saying, “No, stop. Take me home.” She described the suspect’s response as, “We’re just having fun.” Noor detailed the sequence of events, including the drive to the garage, parking, and her attempts to exit the vehicle.

With Noor’s consent, officers conducted a thorough documentation of the vehicle’s interior and exterior, including photographs of the backseat seating area, door handles, and the child lock switch. The documentation was neutral and factual, with no indications of disturbance noted at the time of inspection. Noor reported that the suspect briefly activated the child locks, which she attempted to disengage twice before successfully exiting the vehicle.

A physical examination revealed a bruise forming on Noor’s thigh consistent with her account. She consented to photographic documentation of the injury using a scale for reference. Emergency Medical Services were offered on scene; however, Noor declined immediate medical attention, opting instead to undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination later that day.

Digital evidence was also collected with Noor’s consent. A text message from the suspect stating, “Sorry if I crossed a line,” was captured. Noor agreed to allow imaging of her device at a later time should she choose to proceed with further digital evidence collection.

Witness information was obtained from a neighbor who observed Noor arriving at the location visibly upset. Contact information for the witness was recorded for potential follow-up.

Surveillance footage from the garage’s CCTV system was requested and preserved, covering the timeframe from 18:05 to 18:45 on the previous day. Property management was notified via email to ensure retention of relevant video evidence.

On September 25, 2025, at approximately 18:08 hours, Officers Carter and Velasquez responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at the campus housing complex, specifically Room 3B Lounge. Upon arrival, officers made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Piper,” who was accompanied by her roommates. Piper requested to speak privately in the lounge area, and consent to record the interview was obtained.

Piper provided a free narrative of the incident, stating that she and the suspect had been watching a movie in her room when the suspect touched her under her shirt despite her verbal refusal. She explicitly stated, “I said I didn’t want sex,” and when the suspect continued, she said “No, stop,” and opened the door to end the interaction. Officers clarified the sequence of events, during which Piper recounted the suspect’s response as “Don’t be like that.”

The officers documented the scene by photographing the bedroom doorway, the position of the couch, and the path leading to the hallway to preserve the physical context of the incident. Privacy was maintained throughout the process; officers angled their cameras downward when other individuals passed through the area.

A medical assessment was conducted visually; no physical injuries were observed. Piper reported experiencing anxiety related to the incident. The Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam was discussed with Piper, who expressed a preference to delay the medical examination at this time. Paper bags were provided for the preservation of any clothing she might later submit as evidence.

Digital evidence was preserved, including a message from the suspect stating, “Can we talk?” A screenshot with a timestamp was captured for investigative purposes.

Roommates who were present during the incident were interviewed. One roommate reported hearing Piper say “No” and observed the suspect leaving the room quickly. Contact information for the witness was obtained for follow-up.

On September 26, 2025, at approximately 16:56 hours, Sgt. Salazar and P.O. Keane responded to a sexual assault report at Lakeside Park, specifically near the boat dock bench area. Upon arrival, officers met with the reporting party, identified as “Hannah” for confidentiality purposes. Hannah consented to have the interaction recorded via body-worn cameras. Due to ambient noise near the dock, officers and Hannah relocated to the nearby ranger office to conduct a quieter and more private interview.

Hannah provided a free narrative account of the incident, stating that the previous evening she had been sitting on the dock with the suspect. She explicitly communicated that she did not want any sexual contact. Despite her clear refusal, the suspect proceeded to touch her inappropriately. Hannah recalled verbally telling the suspect “No, stop,” and when he held her waist, she said “Let me go,” to which the suspect responded, “Just a sec.” These direct quotes were documented verbatim during the interview.

Officers conducted a thorough scene documentation, taking photographs of the dock, bench, and surrounding path lighting. It was noted that the ambient sound of water could potentially interfere with audio recordings captured by body-worn cameras. A medical examination revealed minor redness consistent with the reported contact; photographs of the injury were taken with a measurement scale for evidentiary purposes. Hannah opted for a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination, and arrangements were made for her transport to the medical facility as well as for an advocate to accompany her.

Potential witnesses were identified, including a fisherman known as “Ari,” who may have been present near the scene at the time of the incident. Officers attempted to contact Ari through the marina office and left a business card on the community board to facilitate further communication. Digital evidence was preserved, including a text message from the suspect stating, “I misread,” which may pertain to the incident. Additionally, parking lot CCTV footage covering the timeframe of 22:10 to 23:00 was preserved with cooperation from ranger staff.

Narrative:

On September 28, 2025, at approximately 20:03 hours, Officers Li (#2631) and Gomez (#2740) responded to a sexual assault report at Midtown Gym, located in the corridor leading to Locker B. Upon arrival, the officers met with the reporting party, identified as “Tara,” at the front desk. The gym manager escorted Tara to a private office to ensure confidentiality and safety. Consent to record the interview was obtained from Tara prior to beginning the statement.

Tara provided a free narrative account of the incident, stating that while near the lockers, an unidentified male individual touched her inappropriately despite her verbal refusal. She stated, “Near the lockers he touched me even though I said no. I said ‘Stop’ and moved his hand.” Officers clarified the sequence of events, during which Tara recalled the suspect saying, “Just a sec,” before the contact occurred.

The officers documented the scene by photographing the corridor and entrance area, taking care to maintain privacy and avoid capturing any unrelated individuals. Tara reported soreness in her wrist, which was photographed with a scale for evidentiary purposes. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were offered on scene; however, Tara opted for a delayed Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination.

A witness, a gym member, corroborated Tara’s account by stating they heard Tara say “Stop” during the incident. The officers also requested preservation of CCTV footage from hallway cameras covering the time frame between 19:20 and 19:55 to assist with the investigation.

In accordance with gym policy and to ensure safety, the manager suspended the suspect’s access to the facility immediately. Tara was provided with resources, including contact information for victim support services and the case number for reference.

Before concluding the interview, Tara confirmed the summary of her statement and added a descriptive detail that the suspect was carrying a towel with a black stripe.

The officers remained on scene until 21:02 hours, ensuring all necessary documentation, evidence collection, and victim support measures were completed.

Narrative:

On September 28, 2025, at approximately 06:13 hours, I, Sgt. Salazar, along with P.O. Keane, responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at the Depot Lofts freight corridor. Upon arrival, we met with the reporting party, who identified herself as “Sloane,” inside the freight office. After obtaining her consent to record the interview, Sloane provided a free narrative of the incident.

Sloane stated that while she was checking shipments in the freight corridor, a male individual touched her after she explicitly said “no.” She immediately stepped away from the suspect. When asked to clarify the sequence of events, Sloane recalled that the suspect responded by saying, “It’s fine.” She described the suspect as wearing a neon vest and identified him as a vendor.

We proceeded to document the scene, taking photographs of the freight corridor, pallet area, and all exits to preserve evidence and provide context for the investigation. No visible injuries were noted on Sloane during the examination. We discussed the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination with her; however, she was undecided at that time.

A witness, identified as a loader working in the area, reported seeing Sloane exit the freight corridor visibly upset. This contact was logged for further follow-up. We also requested preservation of CCTV footage from the loading dock cameras covering the timeframe of 05:30 to 06:15 hours to assist in identifying the suspect and corroborating the victim’s account.

Safety planning was discussed with Sloane, including potential schedule adjustments to avoid contact with the suspect and advisement that if the suspect was a third-party vendor, a trespass warning could be issued to prevent future access to the premises. We provided Sloane with resources for support and counseling and issued a case number for reference.

At 07:09 hours, the interview concluded after reading back a summary of the report to Sloane, who confirmed the accuracy of the information and reiterated the suspect’s description.

This report will be forwarded to the investigative unit for further action, including review of CCTV footage and follow-up interviews. All evidence and documentation have been secured in accordance with department protocols.

On September 29, 2025, at approximately 12:04 hours, Officers Ebner and Fox responded to a call classified as a sexual assault report at the residence located at 18 Rosewood. Upon arrival, officers met with the reporting party, identified as “Mira,” on the backyard patio. Consent to record the interview was obtained, and privacy was maintained throughout the interaction, with a nearby neighbor waving but not interfering.

Mira provided a free narrative of the incident, stating that while seated on the outdoor couch, the suspect placed his hand under her top without consent. She immediately told him “No, stop,” after which he attempted the action once more. The timeline of the incident was clarified to have occurred between 11:30 and 11:45 a.m. During this time, the suspect reportedly said, “Don’t be shy.” Officers documented these quotes verbatim.

Scene documentation included photographs of the patio area, specifically the couch, coffee table, and sliding door. Officers noted the presence of shadows and the height of the privacy fence, which could be relevant to the investigation.

Mira was examined for visible injuries; none were observed. The option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was discussed with her. Mira chose to delay this examination but was provided with information on how to proceed should she decide to pursue it later.

A witness, a neighbor who was watering plants nearby, reported seeing the suspect leave the area quickly following the incident. Contact information for this witness was obtained and recorded.

Digital evidence was preserved, including a text message from the suspect to Mira stating, “Sorry if I went too far.” Officers provided Mira with safety planning resources, including arranging for a friend to pick her up and a resource sheet containing support services. The case number was also provided.

Before concluding the interview at 13:01 hours, Mira confirmed the summary of her statement and added identifying details about the suspect. She described him as wearing a knit beanie, white sneakers, and having a small anchor tattoo on his forearm.

This report will be forwarded to the detective unit for further investigation. All evidence and statements have been documented and preserved according to department protocol.

Narrative:

On September 29, 2025, at approximately 17:24 hours, Officers Carter and Velasquez responded to a report of a sexual assault at City Market, Service Hall E. Upon arrival, the officers proceeded to the manager’s office where they met with the reporting party, identified as “Kara” for confidentiality purposes. Kara consented to have the interaction recorded via body-worn cameras.

Kara provided a free narrative account of the incident, stating that near the mop sink area within the service hall, an unidentified male individual touched her inappropriately despite her verbal refusal. She stated, “Near the mop sink, he touched me even after I said no. I moved away.” When asked to clarify the sequence of events, Kara recounted that the suspect said, “Just a minute,” before the unwanted contact occurred.

Officers documented the scene by taking photographs of the service hall, focusing on the mop sink area and surrounding doorways. No evaluative comments were made during this process to maintain objectivity. Kara was examined for visible injuries; none were observed. The possibility of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was discussed with Kara, but she was undecided at the time.

A witness, identified as a vendor working nearby, reported hearing a door slam around the time of the incident. Contact information for the witness was obtained for further follow-up. Officers also requested preservation of CCTV footage from corridor cameras covering the time frame between 16:45 and 17:15 to assist in the investigation.

Safety planning measures were discussed with the supervisor, who adjusted staff stations and provided resources to support Kara. A case number was assigned, and a summary of the report was read back to Kara for confirmation. She verified the accuracy of the summary and added a description of the suspect’s attire, noting that he wore a red apron and a black cap.

The officers concluded their on-scene investigation at 18:22 hours. The case remains open pending further review of CCTV footage and witness statements. Follow-up actions will include contacting the SANE nurse should Kara decide to proceed with a medical examination and continuing efforts to identify and locate the suspect based on the description provided.

Narrative:

On September 30, 2025, at approximately 19:06 hours, Officers Doyle and Kravitz responded to a report of a sexual assault at the Greenline Trail, specifically near the Meadow Spur area. Upon arrival at the ranger station adjacent to the trail, we met with the reporting party, identified as “Bree,” who consented to have the interaction recorded via body-worn cameras.

Bree provided a free narrative account of the incident. She stated that she and the suspect had stopped at the Meadow Spur location when the suspect placed his hand inside her waistband without consent. Bree immediately told the suspect to stop and stepped back to create distance. When asked to clarify the sequence of events, Bree recalled that the suspect reassured her by saying, “We’re alone, it’s fine,” despite her clear objection.

The officers documented the scene with photographs taken at sunset, capturing the spur, a nearby bench, and the approach path. It was noted that lighting conditions would become limited after approximately 19:30 hours, which could affect visibility in the area.

A minor scratch was observed on Bree’s skin, which was photographed with a scale for evidentiary purposes. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were offered to Bree, but she declined immediate medical attention. Bree was informed about the availability of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) for further examination, which she later agreed to pursue.

A potential witness, described as a jogger who may have passed by the area during the incident, was mentioned. A witness card was pinned to the nearby board to encourage any individuals with information to come forward.

No digital evidence such as photos or videos from Bree’s devices was provided at the time of the report.

Safety planning was discussed with Bree, including arrangements for a friend to pick her up from the location. She was also provided with a resource sheet containing contact information for support services and was given the case number for reference.

Before concluding the interview, Bree confirmed the accuracy of the summary read back by the officers. She added that the suspect was carrying a pack with distinctive orange straps and had a metal mug clipped to it, which may assist in identifying the individual.

The officers remained on scene until 20:02 hours, ensuring Bree’s safety and completing all necessary documentation.

This report will be forwarded to the appropriate investigative unit for follow-up. Bree has been advised on her rights and the available support services.

Assisting Officer: P.O. Ortega (#2688)  
Call Type: Sexual Assault Report  

Narrative:  
On October 4, 2025, at approximately 00:27 hours, Sgt. Patel and P.O. Ortega responded to a sexual assault report at the 44 Easton Bar, specifically the patio nook area. Weather conditions were clear with a temperature of 72°F. Upon arrival, officers observed a lively atmosphere with music playing and patrons socializing under string lights and patio heaters.

The complainant, identified as Skye, a woman in her mid-20s, was located seated with a friend named Jules. Skye appeared visibly upset, tearful with smudged mascara. After obtaining consent to record the interview, officers escorted Skye to a quieter staff office to discuss the incident in detail.

Skye recounted meeting a man near the heaters earlier that evening. She described a brief interaction involving consensual kissing, followed by the man placing his hand on her thigh. Skye stated she said “No, stop” and the man responded with “Relax,” but he attempted the contact again. She then left the area immediately. Skye estimated the entire interaction lasted approximately one minute. There were no visible injuries noted on Skye, aside from makeup that appeared to be running due to tears.

Officers clarified that Skye initiated the kissing but emphasized that she withdrew consent when the man touched her thigh. Skye confirmed she left the vicinity voluntarily and the man did not follow her. Officers discussed the option of a forensic exam with Skye, explaining it could be a lengthy process and might yield limited evidence due to the contact occurring over clothing. Skye hesitated and deferred the decision, with her friend suggesting she consider it the following day. Officers respected this choice and did not insist on immediate examination.

The bar manager indicated that CCTV cameras were primarily positioned to monitor entrances and exits, with limited coverage of the patio area. Officers requested preservation of footage around midnight but did not submit a formal preservation request. Scene documentation was minimal, consisting of a single wide-angle photograph of the heater area without scale or lighting notes.

Jules provided a witness statement and disclosed consuming two alcoholic beverages. Sgt. Patel expressed concern that friends might influence each other’s accounts. The suspect was described vaguely; Skye identified the man’s hat as blue with a logo, though officers noted this was a common item in the area.

Skye mentioned the suspect’s Instagram handle, but officers deferred digital evidence collection to a later time. The tone of the interview included normalization of the social environment, with officers noting that “mixed signals” and “people getting handsy by heaters” were common occurrences. Safety advice was brief, recommending Skye stay with her friend and report any further contact to security personnel.

Sgt. Patel summarized the incident as a brief contact without force, emphasizing that Skye withdrew and the suspect did not pursue her. The suspect’s statement “Relax” was noted. No advocate was contacted, and the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam was discussed but deemed optional and likely low yield. The case notes highlighted factors such as alcohol consumption, crowd density, and the consensual kissing preceding the incident.

The bar manager suggested the suspect paid with a card; officers requested that if the payment information was easily accessible, it could be emailed to the department but advised not to prioritize this during the night. No formal evidence preservation letter was issued.

Skye was provided with a case number and encouraged to contact the department if she wished to add details later. The officers cleared the scene at approximately 01:20 hours. Sgt. Patel’s concluding remarks indicated the incident was likely a misunderstanding with minimal evidence and the victim’s uncertainty about the event.

CAD#: 25-240912  

On October 4, 2025, at approximately 12:15 PM, Officers Li and Gomez responded to a sexual assault report at 2130 Briarwood Lane, Apartment 1D. Upon arrival, the scene was observed to be a tidy living room. The reporting party, identified as “Iris,” was seated at a table appearing composed and calm. Officer Li noted quietly to Officer Gomez that the scene appeared “staged neat.”

After obtaining consent to record the interview, Officer Li began with a focused prompt, requesting Iris to concentrate on the specific physical contact she was reporting rather than providing a detailed account of the entire evening. Iris recounted that she and the suspect had been cuddling while watching a show. She stated that she communicated her desire to stop further contact, but the suspect touched her chest and hip over her clothing despite her verbal refusal. She asked the suspect to leave the premises.

Officer Li clarified that Iris had invited the suspect to the residence and that some consensual physical contact had occurred initially, to which Iris confirmed they had cuddled. Officer Gomez conducted a brief scan of the apartment and took two photographs, noting the environment appeared consistent with normal post-party conditions.

A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) was presented to Iris but framed the examination as optional, noting that brief contact over clothing often yields limited forensic evidence and that the decision to proceed could be made later. Iris expressed hesitation and indicated she would consider the exam at a later time.

Officer Li pressed for a timeline, suggesting the encounter lasted approximately ten minutes; Iris responded that it was longer, though Li documented the incident as a “brief encounter.” A text message from the suspect was reviewed on scene, reading, “Sorry if I pushed too far.” Officer Li saved the message for potential future relevance but did not take a screenshot at that time.

A potential neighbor witness was considered, but officers decided against knocking due to the time of day and the likelihood that residents were resting. Officer Li inquired about any recent arguments or involvement of an ex-partner to explore possible motives; Iris denied any such context. The relationship between Iris and the suspect remained unclear.

Iris described physically pushing the suspect’s hand away twice, which Officer Li paraphrased as “hesitation.” Safety planning was minimal, with advice limited to “keep your phone on you,” and a rights information sheet was provided without detailed explanation.

The property manager mentioned the presence of CCTV cameras; however, officers determined these cameras likely did not capture footage inside doorways and did not request preservation of any recordings.

Officer Li summarized the report to Iris, characterizing the incident as “cuddling escalated, you said stop, he left,” noting no injuries, no witnesses, and low evidentiary value. Iris appeared deflated by this assessment. Officer Gomez was overheard muttering “probably messy boundaries.” Officer Li provided Iris with a case card and suggested she “sleep on it” and consider the exam the following day if desired.

The scene was cleared at 1:06 PM. Post-incident narration by Officer Li described Iris as “very composed” and “feels rehearsed,” recommending the documentation of the case as “ambiguous.”

Call Type: Sexual Assault Report  

Narrative:  
On October 5, 2025, at approximately 16:12 hours, Officers Hwang and Cutter responded to a report of a sexual assault at the Boardwalk Underpass, North Ramp. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as “Nova,” was located standing under the shaded concrete area near the underpass. The weather was cloudy with a temperature of 66°F.  

Officer Hwang initiated the interview by requesting Nova to provide a brief overview of the incident. Nova stated that she had been leaving the beach area when an unidentified male individual touched her inappropriately under the bridge. She described the contact as brief and stated that she told the individual to “Stop” and moved away from him. Nova indicated that prior to the incident, she and the male had been talking on the beach in a friendly manner, with some light flirting suggested by the male’s comment, “Why are you acting shy?” to which she responded “No” twice.  

During the interview, Officer Hwang inquired about Nova’s alcohol consumption to assess memory reliability, given the time of day and environmental factors such as sunlight. Nova admitted to having consumed one alcoholic drink earlier in the day. This was noted for the record.  

The officers conducted a limited scene documentation, capturing one wide-angle shot of the area but did not provide detailed context regarding lighting or the exact positions of the parties involved. Officer Cutter commented that the underpass area is commonly crowded during hot weather, which may affect witness availability.  

Nova was informed about the option of undergoing a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam; however, she declined, citing the outdoor nature of the contact (over clothing) and the anticipated lengthy waiting period.  

Potential witness “Leo” was mentioned by Nova as someone who might have been nearby. Officer Hwang advised that surfers typically avoid involvement in such incidents and suggested that pursuing this witness was optional. Nova did not express a strong desire to involve Leo, and the decision was made not to pursue witness statements further.  

Regarding surveillance, Officer Hwang noted the presence of a city pole camera but explained that city cameras rarely capture angles under the underpass. No request was made to preserve footage. Nova was advised to retain any digital communications from the suspect, such as text messages, but was also told that blocking the individual was acceptable for her safety.  

Safety planning was briefly addressed with a recommendation that Nova avoid walking alone through the underpass at dusk. No additional resources or victim support services were reviewed or offered during the interaction.  

At the conclusion of the interview, Officer Hwang summarized the incident on camera, noting the brief contact, prior friendly interaction, absence of injury, and lack of corroborating evidence. Nova quietly reiterated that the suspect had touched her twice, which was acknowledged by Officer Hwang.  

After Nova departed the scene, Officer Cutter remarked to Officer Hwang that the incident appeared to be “beach vibes drama.” Officer Hwang concurred and indicated the case would be coded as informational, reflecting the limited evidence and circumstances.  

The officers cleared the scene at 17:02 hours. No further investigative actions were initiated at that time.

On October 5, 2025, at approximately 10:35 hours, officers Sgt. Kim and P.O. Alvarado responded to a report of a sexual assault at the community garden shed located within the park. The weather was hot, approximately 89°F. Upon arrival, officers met with the reporting party, identified as “Sage,” outside the sun-exposed garden shed.

Sage reported that while sorting tools inside the shed, an individual, a fellow volunteer, placed a hand on her waist and attempted to make further physical contact. Sage stated she immediately told the individual to “Stop.” Sgt. Kim sought to clarify the nature of the contact, asking if it could have been incidental due to the crowded volunteer space. Sage firmly stated that the individual “grabbed” her, indicating the contact was intentional rather than accidental.

P.O. Alvarado conducted a brief visual inspection of the shed’s interior, noting it was cluttered, which could contribute to close physical proximity among volunteers. One photograph of the interior was taken for documentation purposes.

Sgt. Kim discussed the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination with Sage, explaining that it might be excessive for what appeared to be a brief grab and could result in loss of volunteer time. Sage appeared uncertain and declined the examination at that time, indicating she might consider it later.

A witness, the garden coordinator, was mentioned as having heard raised voices but was not contacted on scene. Sgt. Kim suggested the raised voices could have been related to tool disputes rather than the reported incident. A volunteer sign-in sheet was present but was not requested or reviewed during the investigation.

Sgt. Kim inquired about any prior conflicts or complaints involving the individual in question, particularly regarding volunteer assignments or turf disputes. Sage denied any such issues. Sgt. Kim noted the possibility of volunteer rivalry but found no evidence supporting this as a motive.

Sage confirmed there were no physical injuries or marks on her waist. Sgt. Kim acknowledged the lack of injury and described the contact as minimal. Safety advice was limited to recommending Sage avoid being alone with the individual. No options regarding trespassing or schedule changes were offered unless requested by Sage.

The presence of CCTV cameras at the park entrance was mentioned; however, Sgt. Kim stated that the camera angles would not be helpful and did not request preservation of footage.

In summary, Sgt. Kim characterized the incident as brief contact in a cramped space with no injuries and unclear intent. Sage countered that the individual had blocked the aisle, to which Sgt. Kim responded that narrow aisles commonly cause such blockages.

After Sage left the scene, Sgt. Kim instructed P.O. Alvarado to document the incident as low priority, describing it as a boundary confusion rather than a clear assault.

The officers cleared the scene at 11:28 hours.

No further action was taken at the time, and the case remains open pending any additional information or complaints.

On October 6, 2025, at approximately 18:01 hours, Officers Doyle and Kravitz responded to a report of a sexual assault at the gazebo area of 500 City Gardens. The weather was sunny with a temperature of 82°F. Upon arrival, several teenagers were observed in the vicinity. A female identified as “Remi” was approached and invited to speak with officers.

After obtaining verbal consent to record the interview, Officer Doyle initiated the statement by requesting Remi to focus on the specific incident, starting at the point where unwanted contact occurred. Remi described sitting on the grass with another individual, during which she verbally expressed “No” as the subject touched her thigh and hip. The individual then left the area. Remi indicated that prior to the contact, they had been talking and socializing in a friendly manner, though not necessarily laughing or engaging in overtly playful behavior.

Photographs of the scene were limited to one wide-angle shot, with Officer Doyle noting that the presence of grass on clothing was typical for a park setting and did not necessarily indicate physical altercation or struggle. A witness named “Ava” approached the scene but was not interviewed or documented at that time; Officer Kravitz informed her that she would be contacted if further information was needed.

Remi mentioned the possibility of undergoing a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination but expressed uncertainty about its usefulness given that the contact was over clothing and no injuries were apparent. Officer Doyle advised that there was no urgency and that Remi could decide later if she wished to pursue the examination.

During the interview, Remi displayed a direct message on her phone from the alleged assailant stating, “You’re overreacting.” Officer Doyle characterized this message as “banter” and advised Remi to save it if she wished but did not record or seize the message as evidence.

Officer Doyle summarized the incident as a brief, mutual hangout that culminated in unwanted touching without physical injury or pursuit by the suspect. Safety planning was minimal, with the only recommendation being for Remi to leave the area with her roommate. A rights information sheet was provided to Remi in a brief manner.

The interview concluded with Officer Doyle noting that cases of this nature rarely progress without video evidence. The officers cleared the scene at 18:54 hours.

No physical evidence was collected, and no further witnesses were interviewed at the time. The case remains open pending additional evidence or statements.

Weather: Clear, 79°F  

At approximately 07:29 hours on October 6, 2025, Officers Ebner and Fox responded to a report of a sexual assault at Office Park Lot C, Bay 42. Upon arrival, officers met with the reporting party, identified as “Priya,” near her sedan. Officer Ebner initiated the interview by requesting that Priya focus on the events occurring after she and the alleged suspect were in the backseat of the vehicle.

Priya recounted an incident involving unwanted touching by the suspect, stating clearly that she said “No” and exited the vehicle quickly. Officer Ebner observed Priya’s leg for any visible injuries but noted no bruising at that time. Priya indicated that bruising was beginning to develop, but no photographs were taken as the officer remarked it was difficult to document injuries at such an early stage.

Vehicle documentation was not conducted, with Officer Ebner commenting that all cars looked similar and there was nothing noteworthy to record. The officers explored the nature of the relationship between Priya and the suspect, noting that they were coworkers who had socialized recently, including having coffee together the previous week. This was documented as “Prior socializing.”

The possibility of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was discussed. Officer Ebner framed the SANE process as lengthy and potentially low yield given the brief nature of the encounter in the car. Priya stated she would consider the option.

Regarding evidence collection, the officers noted the presence of CCTV cameras in the parking lot but decided against requesting footage due to the volume of vehicles and the complexity of retrieving relevant video. A digital message from the suspect to Priya reading “We good?” was shown to the officers; however, Officer Ebner deemed the message vague and not probative, and no screenshot was taken.

A potential witness, a coworker who reportedly saw Priya exit the vehicle, was mentioned. Officer Fox dismissed this as “office gossip” and did not obtain contact information or a formal statement.

Officers provided Priya with a case card and advised her to contact Human Resources if she experienced any awkwardness or further issues at work. The summary of the incident emphasized the ambiguity of the situation, noting the brief contact between coworkers, the absence of physical marks, and the lack of usable witnesses or evidence.

At 08:20 hours, officers cleared the scene. In a subsequent conversation in the stairwell, Officer Ebner described the incident as having an “HR dispute vibe,” suggesting the matter might be more appropriately handled through workplace channels rather than criminal prosecution.

No further investigative actions were taken at the scene. The case remains open pending any additional information or evidence.

Assisting Officer: P.O. Velasquez (#2079)  
Weather Conditions: Overcast, 69°F  

On October 7, 2025, at approximately 21:49 hours, Officers Carter and Velasquez responded to a call classified as a sexual assault report at 75 Willow Glen, Unit 3D. Upon arrival, the officers encountered the reporting party, identified as Keira, who was accompanied by her roommate. The roommate remained nearby throughout the interaction but did not provide a formal statement at that time.

Officer Carter obtained verbal consent from Keira to record the interview. The purpose of the interview was to clarify the circumstances surrounding the alleged non-consensual sexual contact. Keira explained that she had invited the male subject into her residence and initially engaged in consensual kissing. However, when the subject attempted to escalate physical contact beyond the kissing, Keira verbally expressed refusal and instructed him to leave. Despite this, the subject persisted briefly before ultimately departing the premises.

During the interview, Officer Carter questioned the nature of the interaction, emphasizing the initial invitation and consensual kissing, suggesting that the situation did not involve a stranger. Keira maintained that although the initial contact was consensual, she clearly communicated her lack of consent to further advances. The officer’s line of questioning appeared to focus on distinguishing consensual from non-consensual elements of the encounter.

A limited photographic survey of the scene was conducted, including wide-angle shots of the bedroom and the door area. No close-up photographs were taken, and no visible injuries were observed or documented. Officer Carter advised Keira about the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination, describing it as potentially uncomfortable and possibly inconclusive. Keira appeared uncertain about proceeding with the examination.

Digital evidence was briefly referenced when Keira mentioned a text message stating, “Did I go too far?” Officer Carter instructed her to preserve the message but did not capture or review it at the scene. The roommate reported hearing Keira say “No” during the incident; however, no formal witness statement was obtained at that time, with the officer indicating that such information could be collected later if necessary.

Officer Carter inquired about any possible motives or stressors that might have contributed to the incident, such as arguments, academic pressures, or work-related stress. Keira denied any such issues. Safety planning advice was minimal, limited to recommendations to lock her door and to contact the police if the subject returned.

In summarizing the incident, Officer Carter characterized the event as a “home hangout” involving some mutual contact with a brief boundary issue, noting that the subject left the premises and that no injuries were reported. The officers cleared the scene at 22:43 hours. A final comment made by Officer Carter in the stairwell described the offense as “unclear” and referenced “mixed signals” between the parties.

This report reflects the officers’ observations and interactions during the initial response to the sexual assault allegation. Further investigation may be warranted to clarify the circumstances and to obtain additional evidence or witness statements.",-0.006575963718820859,0.4419501133786848,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0

Weather Conditions: Cloudy, 66°F  

Narrative:

On the evening of October 7, 2025, at approximately 21:14 hours, Officers Hwang and Cutter responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the rooftop patio of 88 Lakeview Towers. Upon arrival, the scene was active with a party in progress, characterized by ambient chatter and a night skyline backdrop.

Officer Hwang made contact with the reporting party, identified as Monroe, who consented to be recorded for investigative purposes. Monroe described an interaction that occurred earlier on a couch near a stairwell. She recounted that during a conversation, she expressed verbal refusal—saying “no” and “stop”—when the involved male party placed his hand under her shirt and attempted to continue physical contact. Monroe stated that despite her protests, the male party tried again, prompting her to leave the area. She acknowledged some initial mutual closeness, describing being “a little” cuddled up with the individual prior to the incident.

The officers conducted a preliminary assessment of the scene, noting limited visual evidence due to the nature of the party setting. A single wide-angle shot of the couch area was recorded, but no further detailed scene work was feasible. Security footage from the venue was reviewed briefly but deemed inconclusive and “messy” by Officer Hwang, leading to no formal request for additional footage.

Monroe was informed about the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination process, which was described as potentially lengthy. Monroe elected to postpone the exam and stated she would consider attending at a later time.

A witness named Rae offered to provide information; however, Officer Cutter deferred taking a statement, indicating the possibility of following up later.

During the interview, Officer Hwang referenced a digital message from the involved male party stating, “I thought we were vibing,” which was read aloud and lightly chuckled at by the officer, reflecting the perception of a possible misunderstanding. No digital evidence was captured at the scene.

Officer Hwang summarized the incident as a brief party interaction involving mutual cuddling followed by a misunderstanding, with no physical injuries reported by Monroe. A minimal safety plan was discussed, including a request for venue security to keep the male party away from Monroe.

The officers cleared the scene at 22:06 hours. Officer Hwang remarked to Officer Cutter that the incident was “probably a misread,” indicating the preliminary assessment leaned toward a misunderstanding rather than an assault.

No arrests were made at the scene. The case remains open pending further investigation and potential follow-up with the involved parties.

Date: October 8, 2025  
Reporting Officer: Sergeant Salazar (#2081)  
Secondary Officer: Police Officer Keane (#3775)  
Location: Lakeside Boat Ramp — Bench  
Weather: Mild, 73°F  
Time on Scene: 16:59 to 17:52  

On October 8, 2025, at approximately 16:59 hours, I, Sergeant Salazar, arrived at the Lakeside Boat Ramp in response to a sexual assault report. Upon arrival, I met with the reporting party, identified as “Hannah,” seated on a bench near the dock. Officer Keane was present as secondary officer and recorded body-worn camera footage throughout the interaction.

After obtaining Hannah’s consent to record the interview, I began by clarifying the nature of the alleged contact. Hannah recounted that she had been sitting on the dock when a male individual placed his hands on her hip. She stated that she verbally expressed “No, stop,” to which the male responded, “Just a sec.” Following this, Hannah left the area. I confirmed with her that she had initially gone to the dock willingly and had sat close to the individual, to which she nodded affirmatively. This suggested the interaction began in a friendly manner.

Photographs were taken minimally, as the dock area appeared uniform and unlikely to provide distinguishing evidence. I discussed the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination with Hannah, explaining that it might not be warranted given the contact was over clothing and limited to touching. Hannah hesitated but ultimately chose to defer the examination.

During the interview, Hannah mentioned a witness, a fisherman named “Ari.” Officer Keane noted that fishermen in the area typically keep to themselves, and no canvassing of the area was conducted. I inquired about any available surveillance footage; there is CCTV coverage in the parking lot adjacent to the boat ramp. However, I noted that nighttime glare significantly degrades the quality of these cameras, and no preservation request was made.

Hannah referenced a digital text message from the individual involved, stating “I misread.” I acknowledged that such a message could be interpreted in various ways and did not request a screenshot or further digital evidence.

A minimal safety plan was discussed, advising Hannah not to meet the individual alone in the future. The summary of the incident was framed as a casual meeting with brief physical contact, after which Hannah left the scene and the male did not pursue her further.

At 17:52 hours, the interview concluded, and we cleared the scene. Based on the information gathered, the likelihood of substantiating a sexual assault under the current definitions appears low. The contact described was brief, over clothing, and did not escalate despite Hannah’s expressed discomfort.

This report is submitted for record and further review as necessary.

Assisting Officer: P.O. Fox (#2577)  

On October 8, 2025, at approximately 22:03 hours, I, Officer Ebner, arrived at 52 Laurel Bistro in response to a reported sexual assault incident in the staff locker corridor. Upon arrival, I met with the reporting party, identified as “Camila,” in the manager’s office to obtain a statement and assess the situation.

Camila consented to have the interaction recorded on body-worn camera, with the understanding that the recording would focus on the key moments of her account. She described a brief post-shift interaction with an unidentified individual in the locker corridor after closing time. According to Camila, the contact was unwanted, and she expressed refusal by saying “No” before leaving the area. She reported no physical injuries or marks resulting from the interaction. When asked, Camila confirmed there were no visible injuries on her chest or elsewhere.

Photographic documentation was limited to a wide-angle shot of the locker corridor, which was noted to be in disarray, making detailed evidence collection challenging. The Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was discussed; however, Camila described the procedure as invasive and indicated it would likely be unhelpful given that the contact occurred over clothing. She declined to undergo the examination.

A coworker witness reported hearing a loud slam, which was speculated to be the sound of a locker door closing. No direct physical contact was observed or recorded by witnesses. Attempts to review CCTV footage were unsuccessful due to steam fogging the kitchen cameras, rendering the footage unusable. No digital evidence such as video or audio recordings was available or requested.

The overall environment was described as noisy and chaotic, with the locker area cluttered and difficult to monitor. The brief nature of the interaction, absence of physical injury, and lack of corroborating evidence contributed to uncertainty regarding the incident’s specifics.

The incident was summarized as a brief post-shift encounter with no visible injury and occurring in a noisy, cluttered environment, leading to unclear circumstances surrounding the alleged sexual assault. Camila was advised of her options and the availability of support services.

The scene was cleared at 22:55 hours with no further action taken at that time. This report will be submitted for review and any necessary follow-up investigation.

Assisting Officer: P.O. Velasquez (#2079)  

On October 9, 2025, at approximately 21:05 hours, Officers Carter and Velasquez responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the 700 Grand Hotel, Room 605. Upon arrival, hotel security granted access to the room. The complainant, identified as “Lena,” appeared calm and cooperative throughout the interaction.

After obtaining verbal consent to record the interview, Officer Carter began documenting the complainant’s account of the incident. Lena described meeting a male acquaintance at a bar earlier in the evening where they engaged in light conversation and mutual flirting. She recounted that they later went to the hotel room together. While in the room, the male subject touched her inside her dress without her consent. Lena stated she verbally declined by saying “No,” after which the subject attempted to touch her again but subsequently left the room.

During the interview, Officer Carter noted the prior social interaction between the parties, describing it as “prior flirting” and that they had been “chatting” rather than laughing together at the bar. The complainant’s demeanor remained composed, and she declined to pursue a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination, describing it as “not pleasant” and potentially “overkill.”

The officers conducted a brief inspection of the hotel room. Photographs taken were limited, with Officer Carter commenting that hotel rooms typically appear tidy regardless of incident. Security personnel offered to provide keycard access logs for the room, which Officer Carter acknowledged and stated they would “circle back if needed.” No preservation letter was requested for hotel surveillance cameras, as no footage was immediately available.

A neighboring hotel guest reportedly heard voices from the adjacent room, but no further information was collected due to the thin walls and lack of clarity. Officer Carter noted a digital text message on the complainant’s phone reading “Can we talk?” which was interpreted as a common post-date communication and was not captured as evidence.

In summary, the incident involved a brief, non-consensual touching inside the complainant’s dress in a hotel room following mutual social interaction at a bar. There were no reported injuries or physical evidence collected at the scene. The officers concluded the interview and cleared the scene at 21:59 hours. Officer Carter’s final remark in the hallway suggested skepticism regarding the nature of the complaint, stating “Buyer’s remorse?”

This report is submitted for further review and investigation as deemed appropriate. All evidence and statements have been documented in accordance with department protocol.

Location: City Library — Archives Room  
Time on Scene: 13:19 to 14:10  

On October 9, 2025, at approximately 13:19 hours, I, Officer Doyle, arrived at the City Library Archives Room in response to a reported sexual assault. The weather was overcast with a temperature of 68°F. Upon arrival, I met with the reporting party, identified as “Wren,” in the administrative office adjacent to the Archives Room.

After obtaining verbal consent to record the interview, I began questioning Wren regarding the incident. Wren described the alleged contact as occurring behind a closed door in the Archives Room. She stated that the individual involved touched her despite her verbal refusal, saying “No.” The subject reportedly responded by saying, “No one comes down here,” implying an attempt to discourage further interaction or witnesses.

I inquired about the relationship between Wren and the alleged assailant, asking if they often studied together or engaged in banter. Wren indicated that they “talk,” suggesting a level of familiarity but not necessarily a close friendship. I noted a rapport between the two parties, which may be relevant to the context of the incident.

Photographic evidence was collected, consisting of a single image of the door to the Archives Room. I noted that the Archives Room’s interior is uniform in appearance, which may affect witness identification or recollection.

I discussed the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination with Wren, explaining that it was probably unnecessary given the nature of the contact described. Wren was undecided about pursuing this option, and I did not leave an informational packet at that time.

I offered to review the sign-in log for the Archives Room to identify potential witnesses or corroborate timelines but deferred this action for later investigation. Additionally, I reviewed a digital apology email purportedly sent by the alleged assailant. The content was vague and lacked header information, limiting its evidentiary value.

A volunteer witness reported seeing both individuals exit the Archives Room but did not observe any physical contact. I noted that students often take sides in such disputes, which could influence witness statements.

In summary, the incident occurred in a quiet, familiar environment with known individuals. The contact was described as momentary, and Wren left the scene promptly. Based on the information gathered during the interview and initial investigation, the circumstances suggest a need for further inquiry but do not conclusively establish criminal conduct at this time.

The scene was cleared at 14:09 hours. Further follow-up actions will include reviewing sign-in logs, attempting to obtain additional witness statements, and evaluating any digital communications related to the incident.

Location: 15 West Alley, behind warehouse  

Reporting Officers: Sgt. Patel (#1876), P.O. Ortega (#2688)  

Narrative:  
On October 10, 2025, at approximately 23:36 hours, Sgt. Patel and P.O. Ortega responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at 15 West Alley, behind a warehouse adjacent to a local club. Upon arrival, officers observed a dimly lit alley with ambient noise from a nearby club. The complainant, identified as “Ari,” a person in their early 20s, was visibly upset and engaged in conversation with a club bouncer who directed officers to Ari.

Consent to record was obtained from Ari at 23:36:35. Sgt. Patel initiated the interview by focusing on the specific contact that caused distress, rather than the entire evening’s events. Ari recounted meeting a male individual near the bar’s side door earlier that evening. According to Ari, the interaction began with a brief mutual kiss. Subsequently, the male placed a hand inside Ari’s shirt. Ari immediately expressed discomfort, stating “No, stop.” The male then asked, “Any chance you’re into it?” Ari responded by pulling away and walking toward the alley.

Sgt. Patel clarified that the initial kiss was mutual and noted the environment was crowded and involved alcohol consumption. The bouncer confirmed seeing Ari exit the club visibly upset but did not provide contact information, as officers indicated they could reach Ari if needed. The club manager mentioned the presence of two CCTV cameras near the dumpster area; however, Sgt. Patel noted that footage from alley cameras is typically of poor quality and requested any footage from around midnight if available.

Ari was informed about the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam but expressed reluctance due to the brief nature of the contact, which was over clothing, and the anticipated long wait times. Sgt. Patel acknowledged this hesitation and suggested Ari could consider the exam the following day. Ari provided a rideshare receipt timestamped at 23:12 and a text message from the male party stating, “Don’t be mad.” Officers advised Ari to retain these items for potential future relevance.

The timeline of the incident was described as brief, approximately one minute or less. Sgt. Patel advised Ari to stay with a friend that night and to alert club staff if the male individual was encountered again, to ensure his exclusion from the premises. Ari was given an incident card and informed that clinics offering exams would open early the following day.

Throughout the interaction, officers maintained a professional demeanor but used language that minimized the severity of the incident, describing it as a “short alley interaction” with “no injury” and “no follow-up.” After Ari stepped aside, P.O. Ortega commented that the situation appeared to be “weekend drama,” a sentiment with which Sgt. Patel concurred, suggesting a possible misinterpretation of intent by the male party.

A cursory inspection of the alley and dumpster area was conducted, but no detailed measurements or lighting assessments were recorded. The officers concluded the scene at 00:28 hours.

Summary:  
The complainant reported a brief unwanted physical contact following a mutual kiss in a crowded club environment. No physical injuries were observed or reported. The complainant declined immediate forensic examination but was informed of options to pursue medical evaluation later. Officers collected limited evidence and witness information, with no formal requests for CCTV footage documented. The incident was assessed as having low evidentiary yield, and no further immediate investigative actions were taken.

Narrative:  
On October 10, 2025, at approximately 21:02 hours, Officers Li and Gomez responded to a call classified as a sexual assault report at 118 Harbor View, Apartment 3C. Upon arrival, officers found the reporting party, identified as “Ava,” seated calmly on a couch with a friend present. Consent to record the interview was obtained from Ava.

Officer Li initiated the interview by focusing on the specific incident that felt non-consensual, requesting to avoid an extensive backstory. Ava recounted that a male coworker had visited her apartment to return a charger. During the visit, they engaged in conversation and briefly kissed. Subsequently, the coworker placed his hand inside her waistband without consent. Ava stated she verbally declined by saying “No, stop,” to which the coworker responded, “Don’t make it weird.” He then briefly blocked her path before leaving the apartment.

Officer Li acknowledged the initial consensual contact but emphasized the boundary violation that followed. Officer Gomez conducted a visual scan of the apartment, noting normal clutter, and took two wide-angle photographs of the scene for documentation purposes.

A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was discussed. Ava was informed that due to the nature of the contact—brief and over clothing—physical evidence might be minimal or absent, and that an exam could be conducted later if she chose. Ava hesitated, and her friend indicated they were tired. Officers agreed that the exam could be scheduled for the following day.

Ava presented a text message from the coworker stating, “Sorry if I pushed.” Officer Li reviewed the message, noting its vagueness, and advised Ava to preserve it, though no digital capture was made at the scene.

A potential witness was identified: a neighbor named Liam in apartment 3B who might have observed the coworker leaving. Officer Li decided not to canvass immediately, citing concerns about disturbing neighbors late at night. Additionally, officers reviewed the building’s lobby CCTV footage but noted such cameras typically do not capture activity inside individual apartment doors and that timestamps may be unreliable. No preservation request for footage was made at that time.

When questioned about any workplace issues that might relate to the incident, Ava denied any performance problems or conflicts. Officer Li made a note indicating the work context was to be determined.

The officers summarized the incident as a short visit involving some consensual contact followed by a boundary violation with no physical injuries. Ava confirmed that the coworker had blocked her path briefly.

Safety planning was addressed; Ava was advised to stay with her friend and keep her phone accessible. A rights information sheet was provided without detailed explanation, and no advocate was contacted during the visit.

After the interview, officers left a contact card with Ava and advised her to email any relevant screenshots if she recalled additional information. Officers exited the premises at 21:08 hours and cleared the scene at 21:55.

No further immediate investigative actions were taken at the scene. Follow-up steps include potential canvassing of neighbors, preservation of CCTV footage if available, and coordination with medical personnel for a possible delayed forensic exam.

Call Type: Sexual Assault Report  
Weather Conditions: Breezy, 75°F, bright sun  

Narrative:

On October 11, 2025, at approximately 16:09 hours, Officers Hwang and Cutter responded to a report of a sexual assault at City Beach, specifically near Dune Path 3. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as “Aria,” was located near the dune path with her arms wrapped around herself, appearing visibly distressed. Consent to record the interview was obtained at 16:09:49.

Aria recounted the events leading to her report, stating that the interaction began with consensual kissing. However, the situation escalated when the male subject placed his hand up her dress without her consent. Aria immediately said “Stop” and moved away, but the subject followed her by a step. She reiterated her command for him to leave. Officer Hwang sought to clarify the non-consensual aspects of the encounter, emphasizing the importance of focusing on the point at which consent was withdrawn.

During the interview, Officer Hwang suggested the possibility that the subject may have misread the situation due to the initial mutual kissing, but Aria firmly maintained that she had clearly communicated her lack of consent. Officer Cutter conducted a visual scan of the complainant’s clothing and body for any signs of injury or abrasion. While sand was noted on her clothes—a common occurrence at the beach—no visible injuries or abrasions were documented, and no photographic evidence with scale was taken.

The option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was explained to Aria, including the potential challenges posed by the sandy environment and elapsed time, which could affect evidence collection. Aria expressed a desire to decide about the exam at a later time, which was acknowledged and accepted by Officer Hwang.

Aria mentioned that a lifeguard had observed them earlier during their interaction. However, officers explained that lifeguards are typically occupied with their duties and do not monitor or track couples on the beach. No contact information for the lifeguard was obtained. The possibility of reviewing CCTV footage from a nearby lifeguard tower camera was discussed, but officers noted that the camera angles are wide and unlikely to capture detailed evidence. Consequently, no preservation request for footage was made.

Regarding digital evidence, Aria reported no current text messages from the subject. Officers advised her to retain any future communications or block the sender as she preferred. A minimal safety plan was discussed, recommending that Aria leave the beach with a friend and avoid secluded paths, especially at dusk.

In summary, the incident involved a brief beach interaction that began with mutual kissing. Aria withdrew consent when the subject’s behavior became non-consensual, specifically when he placed his hand up her dress and followed her after she moved away. Although the subject did not pursue further after her withdrawal, Aria noted that he stepped toward her, which was documented by Officer Hwang.

The officers cleared the scene at 16:59 hours. An off-camera comment noted the incident as “holiday weekend drama,” reflecting the officers’ perception of the situation’s context.

No arrests were made at the scene. The case remains open pending any further evidence or decisions by the complainant regarding medical examination or additional reporting.

Case Number: 66  
Date of Incident: October 11, 2025  
Location: 77 Redwood Office Park, Stairwell B Landing  
Reporting Officer: Sergeant Kim (#1907)

Weather Conditions: Clear, 76°F  
Time on Scene: 17:16:40 to 18:07:05

Narrative:

On October 11, 2025, at approximately 17:16 hours, I, Sergeant Kim, accompanied by Police Officer Alvarado, responded to a report of a sexual assault at 77 Redwood Office Park, specifically at Stairwell B Landing. Upon arrival, I met with the complainant, identified here as “Rosa,” who was accompanied by building security personnel.

After obtaining Rosa’s consent to record the interview, I proceeded to gather details regarding the incident. Rosa stated that while in the stairwell between floors, an individual touched her hip and chest over her coat. She immediately told the individual to stop, stating, “Stop, I need to go,” and then exited the stairwell on the third floor. Rosa indicated that she and the alleged individual had prior interactions at work, though she clarified that they only talked and did not engage in any inappropriate behavior previously.

Security personnel offered access to building logs to verify movements; however, I noted that such logs rarely provide insight into intent and deferred the request for later consideration. Photographs were taken of the stairwell landing to document the scene, including a wide shot of the area. No measurements of the handrails or other physical features were taken, as the landings appeared uniform.

I discussed the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination with Rosa, explaining that since the contact was over clothing and there was no injury, the exam might cause more discomfort than benefit. Rosa appeared uncertain but ultimately chose to delay the examination.

During the interview, Rosa mentioned receiving a vague digital message from the alleged individual stating, “We good?” I chose not to capture this message as it was ambiguous and did not provide clear evidence. A witness named Dev reported seeing Rosa upset, but no direct contact or confrontation was observed. I acknowledged that workplace dynamics might influence perceptions, noting that “office folks take sides.”

CCTV footage was available; however, due to glare from parking lot lighting affecting timestamp accuracy, I did not request preservation of the footage. The summary of the incident was kept minimal, emphasizing that the contact was brief, occurred in a stairwell, followed prior rapport between the parties, and that no injuries were reported.

A safety plan was discussed, advising Rosa to speak with Human Resources regarding scheduling adjustments to avoid further contact with the alleged individual. Rosa was provided with a rights information sheet, though no detailed discussion of rights occurred at that time.

At 18:07 hours, we cleared the scene. Based on the information gathered, the case was considered thin, with limited evidence to support further immediate action.

Case Number: 67  
Date/Time of Incident: October 12, 2025, approximately 13:00 hours  
Location: City Library, Study Room 2C  
Reporting Officer: P.O. Doyle (#3198)  
Assisting Officer: P.O. Kravitz (#2902)  

On October 12, 2025, at approximately 13:10 hours, Officers Doyle and Kravitz responded to a report of a sexual assault at the City Library, specifically in Study Room 2C. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as Elise, was seated inside the study room with a closed notebook. A librarian was present nearby.

After obtaining Elise’s consent to record the interview, Officer Doyle encouraged her to provide a concise account of the incident. Elise described that during a study session with a known acquaintance, the door to the study room was closed. She reported that the individual engaged in unwanted touching despite her verbal refusal, stating “No.” The individual responded with, “Come on, it’s just us.” Elise moved away to remove herself from the situation.

Officer Doyle inquired about the nature of their relationship, to which Elise confirmed they knew each other and studied together often, indicating a baseline level of comfort prior to the incident. Photographs of the scene were taken, including one of the doorway; however, Officer Doyle noted that the chairs in the room are frequently rearranged, making it difficult to ascertain the exact positioning during the incident.

A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) was consulted regarding the possibility of a forensic examination. The SANE advised that while an examination could be conducted, it might be invasive and unlikely to yield significant evidence given that the assault occurred over clothing. Elise stated she would consider this option.

During the interview, Officer Doyle reviewed a text message from the suspect that read, “Sorry if I pushed boundaries.” Doyle commented that such phrasing is common in situations involving mixed signals. No screenshot of the message was preserved.

A potential witness named Jon was mentioned as possibly knocking on the door during the incident; however, no contact was made with this individual. Officer Doyle noted that students often prefer not to get involved in such matters.

The library’s CCTV system includes a corridor camera near the study rooms, but it does not cover the door angles of Study Room 2C. No preservation request for footage was made.

A minimal safety plan was discussed with Elise, which included asking library staff to prevent the suspect from entering the premises if necessary.

In summary, Elise described a brief interaction with an acquaintance during which she clearly communicated refusal and subsequently left the room. No physical injuries were reported or observed. Throughout the interview, Elise appeared visibly distressed, and the librarian provided a tissue for comfort.

The officers cleared the scene at 14:00 hours. The case remains open pending further investigation and any additional evidence or witness statements.

Reporting Officer: P.O. Carter (#1842)  
Secondary Officer: P.O. Velasquez (#2079)  
Location: 18 Rosewood, Backyard Patio  
Weather: Warm, 81°F  
Time on Scene: 12:06:31 to 12:59:44  

On October 12, 2025, at approximately 12:06 hours, I, Officer Carter, along with Officer Velasquez, responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at the residence located at 18 Rosewood. Upon arrival, we found the complainant, identified as Mira, seated on a wicker couch in the backyard patio area. A neighbor was present nearby, tending to plants. The weather was warm and sunny, approximately 81°F.

After introducing ourselves and obtaining consent to record the interview, I engaged Mira in a conversation to clarify the specifics of the incident. Mira described that she had been lounging outdoors with an individual who had been invited over. During this time, the individual placed a hand under her top without her consent. Mira stated she verbally expressed “No, stop,” and the individual attempted the action once more. She then moved away from him, and he subsequently left the premises.

During the interview, I noted that Mira acknowledged prior closeness with the individual, confirming that she had invited him over and that they had been in close proximity before the incident occurred. I documented this as “prior closeness” in my notes.

Photographs of the scene were taken, including a wide shot of the couch area. I observed that the outdoor cushions on the wicker furniture were shifted, which I noted could occur naturally due to outdoor conditions.

Mira was informed about the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination, which I framed as “a lot for not much” given the outdoor setting and brief nature of the contact. Mira opted to wait and declined immediate medical examination.

A neighbor witness reported seeing the individual leave the scene quickly. However, respecting their privacy and weekend plans, we chose not to collect contact information from the neighbor.

During the investigation, a digital message was reviewed that read, “Sorry if I went too far.” This message was noted but not captured as evidence.

A safety plan was discussed with Mira, advising her to stay with a friend for support. She was promptly provided with a rights information sheet outlining her options and resources.

In summarizing the incident, I described the event as a backyard hangout involving a brief, non-consensual touch, after which Mira left the situation. I communicated this summary in a manner that minimized the severity of the incident, which was noted during the off-camera discussion with Officer Velasquez, where I referred to the case as “social spillover—thin,” indicating a perception of limited criminality.

The scene was cleared at 12:59 hours. No further action was taken at that time, pending any additional information or follow-up requests from the complainant.

69,Tier 2 (Subjective/Biasing),"On October 13, 2025, at approximately 17:27 hours, I, Sergeant Salazar (#2081), arrived at the 900 City Market, Service Hall E, in response to a reported sexual assault. The weather was hot, approximately 90°F. Upon arrival, I met with the complainant, identified as “Kara,” in a cramped manager’s office to ensure privacy and begin the initial interview. Officer Keane (#3775) was present as secondary.

After obtaining Kara’s consent to record the interview, I proceeded to gather details regarding the incident. Kara stated that the alleged assailant approached her from behind near the mop sink area within the service hall. She reported that the individual touched her inappropriately despite her verbal objection, saying “No, stop,” and subsequently moved away from the area. During the interview, I asked whether the contact could have been incidental due to the crowded nature of the corridor, but Kara was clear that the person had grabbed her intentionally.

Photographs were taken of the hallway where the incident occurred. However, the corridors in this area are identical in appearance, making it difficult to definitively identify the exact location of the contact. A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) report was reviewed, which described the contact as invasive and prolonged, with minimal clothing interference. Kara chose to defer further medical examination or evidence collection at that time.

A witness vendor in the vicinity reported hearing a door slam around the time of the incident. Officer Keane noted that multiple doors in the area could have produced the noise, and no direct contact or altercation was observed by the witness. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage was reviewed; however, the lenses in the service hall were obscured by steam or fog, rendering the footage unusable for investigative purposes. No preservation request for the footage was made.

Safety personnel advised that scheduling and personnel management issues should be handled by supervisory staff, and this information would be noted for internal review. The overall summary of the incident emphasized the ambiguity of the situation: the corridor was busy, the contact was brief, and no physical injuries were reported or observed.

At 18:15 hours, the scene was cleared. I discussed the case with Officer Keane, concluding that the incident likely stemmed from a workplace dispute or “work spat” rather than a clear-cut sexual assault. The complainant was advised on available resources and reporting options should she choose to pursue further action.

This report is submitted for documentation and further review as necessary.

Assisting Officer: P.O. Fox (#2577)  
Location: Office Park Lot C — Bay 19  
Time on Scene: 07:22:50 to 08:17:36  
Weather: Clear, 79°F  

On October 13, 2025, at approximately 07:22 hours, I, Officer Ebner, arrived at Office Park Lot C, Bay 19, in response to a reported sexual assault incident involving a female complainant identified as “Noor.” Upon arrival, I located Noor standing by her sedan and initiated contact. After introducing myself, I obtained her consent to record the interview and began gathering information pertinent to the report.

Noor explained that the incident occurred during a carpool ride with a male coworker, with whom she had previously ridden, establishing a baseline of familiarity. She described an episode of unwanted physical contact while seated in the backseat of the vehicle. Noor recounted verbally expressing her discomfort by saying, “No, stop. Take me home,” after which she exited the vehicle in Lot C.

During the interview, I focused the scope of questioning specifically on the backseat moment to clarify the nature of the contact. Noor’s account indicated that the contact was brief and unwanted but did not elaborate on further details. She declined to provide vehicle documentation or photographs, stating there was “nothing to photograph.” I assessed the potential for a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination as low yield due to the brief nature of the incident and the lack of physical evidence, though Noor indicated she might consider it later.

A digital text message from the alleged perpetrator, reading “Sorry if I crossed a line,” was presented and reviewed but set aside as it did not provide conclusive evidence. A neighbor witness reportedly observed Noor in an upset state; however, Officer Fox expressed skepticism regarding the reliability of neighbor accounts and did not pursue further witness statements.

Regarding surveillance footage, I determined that the high volume of vehicles in the area rendered the retrieval and preservation of CCTV footage impractical due to the difficulty in isolating the relevant vehicle. Consequently, no footage was preserved.

For Noor’s safety and support, I advised her to contact her employer’s Human Resources department to report the incident and seek assistance. The summary of the incident was framed to reflect the context as a brief encounter with a coworker during a ride, emphasizing that Noor left the vehicle promptly after the unwanted contact.

At 08:17 hours, I cleared the scene. Throughout the investigation, I noted the challenges in evidence collection and the sensitivity of the matter, concluding with a recommendation for Noor to pursue internal workplace remedies. The case remains open pending any further information or evidence.

Narrative:  
On October 14, 2025, at approximately 20:03 hours, I, Officer Hwang, along with Officer Cutter, responded to a report of a sexual assault at Midtown Gym, specifically in the Locker Room B corridor. Upon arrival, I met with the complainant, who identified herself as “Tara.” After obtaining her consent to record the interview, I proceeded to take her statement regarding the incident.

Tara reported that while in the corridor near the lockers, she was cornered by an individual. She described the encounter as unwanted physical contact, stating, “No, stop,” and indicated that the individual placed his hands on her waist and chest over her clothing. Tara was visibly distressed and emphasized that the contact was non-consensual. I noted that the locker room corridor is typically crowded, and I attempted to clarify whether the contact could have been incidental, such as towels or elbows brushing against one another. Tara firmly stated, “He grabbed me,” indicating that the contact was deliberate.

Photographs of the corridor were taken to document the scene; however, only one wide-angle photo was captured due to privacy concerns for other gym patrons. A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) was consulted regarding the possibility of a physical examination. The SANE advised that an examination over clothing might be uncomfortable and unlikely to yield helpful evidence. Tara expressed hesitation and elected to delay any medical examination at that time.

Officer Cutter reported hearing a witness say “Stop” during the incident but indicated that the witness described the situation as “gym gossip” and did not observe any physical contact. We inquired about the availability of CCTV footage from the gym; however, the angles covering the locker room corridor were deemed poor, and no footage was preserved.

Regarding the safety and administrative response, it was noted that the gym management has the authority to suspend the alleged individual pending further investigation. Tara did not report any physical injuries resulting from the incident. The overall summary of the encounter was characterized as brief contact in a busy locker area with no injury.

At approximately 20:54 hours, our interaction concluded. Off-camera remarks suggested that the incident might have involved a misreading of social signals rather than intentional assault.

No further evidence was collected at the scene. The complainant was advised of her options for follow-up and support services. The case remains open pending any additional information or evidence.

Narrative:  
On October 14, 2025, at approximately 06:16 hours, I, Sgt. Patel, responded to a report of a sexual assault at the freight corridor of 260 Depot Lofts. Upon arrival, I met with the reporting party, identified as “Sloane,” near the freight office. Consent to record the interview was obtained at 06:16:21. The purpose of the interview was to gather details regarding the alleged incident.

Sloane reported that while checking shipments in the freight corridor earlier that morning, an individual made unwanted physical contact by grabbing them. Sloane stated, “He grabbed me,” and requested to move to a more open area to continue the discussion. I acknowledged the hectic nature of warehouse mornings, noting that people often bump into each other due to the busy environment. However, Sloane maintained that the contact was intentional and unwelcome.

Photographs were taken of the freight corridor at 06:17:18 to document the scene. The area was described as wide with boxes scattered throughout, making it difficult to isolate the exact location of the contact. A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) was consulted remotely, who advised that work-related contact over clothing rarely shows physical evidence. Sloane declined a physical examination.

A witness, a loader working in the area, reported seeing Sloane upset but did not observe any physical contact between Sloane and the alleged assailant. I noted that early morning moods can be misread due to the nature of the work environment. Review of available CCTV footage from dock cameras was conducted; however, visibility was limited as forklifts frequently blocked the cameras. No formal request for additional footage was made at that time.

Sloane inquired about safety measures, and I suggested possible schedule adjustments to reduce contact during busy periods. The overall summary of the incident was characterized as “dock drama” involving brief contact with no visible injury or physical evidence.

The scene was cleared at 07:07 hours. No further action was taken pending additional evidence or complaints. The report was filed for documentation and potential follow-up.

Narrative:

On October 15, 2025, at approximately 22:02 hours, Officers Ebner and Fox responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the 52 Laurel Bistro, specifically in the staff locker room area. Upon arrival, I, Officer Ebner, made contact with the reporting party, identified as Camila, who was seated in the office area visibly distressed, wringing her hands.

After obtaining Camila’s consent to record the interview, I proceeded to take her statement. Camila recounted that following the restaurant’s closing time, an individual made unwanted physical contact by touching her over her shirt. She immediately expressed her refusal by saying “No” and then left the area. When asked about any physical injuries or marks, Camila confirmed that there were none visible. I noted this as minimal physical evidence.

A photographic survey of the scene was conducted, focusing on the corridor and the locker room. The lockers were described as chaotic, which could potentially affect the investigation of the scene. No clear evidence of physical altercation or disturbance was observed.

A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was offered to Camila; however, she declined, stating that the process would be invasive and likely not helpful in this situation.

Witness statements were reviewed, including a report of a loud slam heard in the vicinity, which was speculated to be a locker door closing rather than an indication of physical contact or struggle. No witnesses reported seeing the incident directly or any physical contact between the parties involved.

CCTV footage from the area was reviewed but deemed unreliable due to steam and fog obscuring the view. Additionally, no digital evidence such as photos or videos were available or preserved.

In summary, the incident involved brief workplace contact of a sexual nature, but the intent behind the contact remains unclear. There is no physical evidence or injuries to corroborate the claim beyond the victim’s statement. The lack of witnesses and unreliable CCTV footage further complicate the investigation.

The scene was cleared at 22:53 hours. The case remains open pending any further evidence or witness statements.

Time on Scene: 22:09 to 23:01  

On October 15, 2025, at approximately 22:09 hours, I, Officer Carter, accompanied by Officer Velasquez, responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the 700 Grand Hotel, Room 1221. Upon arrival, hotel security was present and allowed us entry. Inside the room, the complainant, identified as “Mae,” and a friend were seated on the bed.

After obtaining Mae’s consent to record the interview, I asked her to describe the incident and specifically the part that was not okay. Mae stated that the interaction began with consensual kissing. However, the situation escalated when the male party placed his hand inside her dress without her consent. She clearly said “No” to this action. Despite her refusal, he attempted the same action once more. At that point, Mae pointed toward the door, signaling for him to leave, and he complied.

During the interview, I noted that Mae mentioned they had been laughing together downstairs earlier, suggesting some level of mutual chemistry prior to the incident. I took photographs of the hotel room, capturing a wide shot that showed the room was tidy and undisturbed. The room’s condition appeared consistent with a typical hotel stay.

A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) was present and commented that the situation was “not pleasant” but suggested that further medical intervention might be excessive. Mae declined to pursue additional medical examination or contact an advocate, and I respected her wishes by not making any calls on her behalf.

We reviewed keycard logs for the room to verify entry and exit times but did not find any immediate need to request further information. A neighbor in an adjacent room reported hearing voices due to the hotel’s thin walls but did not witness any altercation or contact.

Digital evidence was considered, but no recordings or messages were captured. I noted a brief exchange where Mae asked, “Can we talk?” and I responded that after awkward nights, people often say that. This exchange was not recorded.

In summary, the incident involved a brief, non-consensual physical contact without injury. Both parties had spent mutual time together at the hotel bar earlier in the evening. The overall interaction appeared to be a brief touch that Mae found unacceptable, but there was no evidence of physical harm or prolonged assault.

At 23:01 hours, we cleared the scene. While discussing the case in the hallway, I noted a “buyer’s remorse vibe,” indicating that the complainant’s feelings might be influenced by regret rather than a clear-cut assault.

This report is submitted for further review and any necessary follow-up actions.

Wren recounted, “He touched me, I said no, he said ‘No one comes down here.’ I left.” This indicates that the contact was unwanted and that the suspect attempted to intimidate Wren to remain in the area. When asked about the relationship between Wren and the alleged assailant, Wren confirmed that they “talk,” suggesting some level of familiarity but did not elaborate on the nature of their interactions.

Photographs were taken of the single door to the Archives Room to document the scene, with the observation that the Archives rooms are similar in appearance, which may be relevant for further investigation or witness statements.

Regarding medical evaluation, the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) was consulted. The SANE indicated that an examination was “probably unnecessary” in this case. Wren was undecided about pursuing a medical exam, and no informational sheet regarding medical or counseling services was provided at that time.

A sign-in log for the Archives Room was offered to Wren to assist with establishing a timeline or corroborating presence but was deferred by Officer Doyle during the initial investigation.

An email apology from the alleged assailant was read aloud during the interview; however, the email headers were not preserved, which may limit the ability to verify the authenticity or origin of the message.

A witness volunteer was present and offered to provide testimony; however, this offer was declined due to concerns that “students take sides,” implying potential bias or conflict among witnesses.

In summary, the incident occurred in a quiet, secluded room where a momentary unwanted touch took place between parties who are somewhat familiar with each other. The reporting party declined further medical examination and additional documentation at this time. The scene was secured, and the interview concluded at 14:05 hours.

Further investigation is recommended to identify the alleged assailant, verify the email apology, and assess any additional witnesses or evidence that may support the case. Follow-up with Wren regarding medical and counseling services should also be considered.

Location: 1100 Lakeside Boat Ramp  
Weather: Sunny, 84°F  
Time on Scene: 16:44 to 17:35  

On October 16, 2025, at approximately 16:44 hours, I, Officer Li, arrived at the 1100 Lakeside Boat Ramp in response to a reported sexual assault. Upon arrival, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Hannah.” After introducing myself and explaining the purpose of the visit, I obtained Hannah’s consent to record our conversation.

Hannah described the incident as occurring while she was sitting on the dock. She stated that the subject placed his hands on her hip, to which she responded by saying “No, stop.” The subject replied, “Just a sec,” after which Hannah left the area. I clarified with Hannah that she had willingly gone to the location and sat close to the subject, to which she nodded in affirmation. Hannah emphasized that the contact was brief and that she withdrew promptly without any further pursuit or chase by the subject.

During the interview, I took minimal scene photographs, noting that the docks in the area are visually similar and blend together, which may complicate precise location identification. I discussed the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination with Hannah, explaining that such a process is lengthy and typically requires removal of clothing. Hannah appeared hesitant and delayed in responding to this suggestion.

I considered potential witnesses and identified a fisherman named “Ari” nearby who might have observed the incident. However, due to the general tendency of fishermen to avoid police interaction, I decided against canvassing the area further for witnesses. I also evaluated the possibility of obtaining CCTV footage from the vicinity but determined that glare issues during nighttime hours would render any footage unusable; therefore, no request was made.

Regarding digital evidence, Hannah mentioned a text message from the subject stating, “I misread.” I acknowledged that this message could have multiple interpretations and did not pursue capturing this evidence at the time.

I advised Hannah on personal safety measures, specifically cautioning her not to meet the subject alone again in the future. A summary of the incident was provided to Hannah, emphasizing that the encounter was a casual meeting with brief physical contact, which she promptly ended by leaving the scene.

No further immediate investigative actions were taken at the scene. The interaction concluded at approximately 17:35 hours, and I cleared the location.

This report is submitted for documentation and further review as necessary.

Weather: Clear, 76°F  

At approximately 10:18 hours on October 17, 2025, I, Sgt. Kim, along with P.O. Alvarado, responded to a report of a sexual assault at 500 Market Street, Office Suite 610, specifically in the phone room. Upon arrival, I met with the complainant, identified as “Maya,” who was accompanied by a Human Resources (HR) representative. The HR representative was present throughout the interview to provide support and ensure procedural compliance.

After obtaining Maya’s consent to record the interview, I began by clarifying the scope of the incident. Maya stated that the alleged inappropriate contact occurred in the phone room and involved unwanted touching after she had explicitly said no. She further explained that she exited the room immediately following the incident. When asked if there were any performance issues or prior complaints related to workplace evaluations that might have precipitated this event, Maya responded negatively, and the HR representative indicated no known concerns.

Photographs were taken of the phone room, focusing on a wide shot of the door area to document the scene. Maya was offered a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination; however, she declined, citing that the contact was over clothing and did not warrant further medical evaluation.

During the interview, I reviewed a digital apology email that Maya had received from the alleged perpetrator. The email was skimmed for content, but no header capture was performed, and no IT hold was requested at this time. A witness reportedly heard the door during the incident, but no direct contact or interaction was confirmed. I noted that this could have been incidental noise unrelated to the event.

Regarding potential surveillance evidence, I inquired about CCTV footage and badge access logs. It was determined that preservation of such evidence was not immediately necessary, and no formal request was made to secure these records.

In summary, the incident was characterized as an office misunderstanding involving brief physical contact with no injury reported. The HR representative and I agreed that this matter would be handled internally as an HR issue rather than a criminal investigation at this stage.

At 11:06 hours, the scene was cleared. Off-camera, I informed P.O. Alvarado that this case would be treated as an HR matter moving forward.

Weather Conditions: Breezy, 79°F

Narrative:

On October 17, 2025, at approximately 16:11 hours, I, Officer Ortega, responded to a report of a sexual assault at the City Beach underpass area. Upon arrival at the designated location, I made contact with the reporting party, who identified herself as “Nova.” Officer Wynn was present as secondary officer and assisted with the investigation.

After introducing myself and explaining the purpose of our visit, I obtained Nova’s consent to record the interview for evidentiary purposes. The interaction was kept brief to minimize distress. Nova described an incident that occurred earlier that day involving unwanted physical contact beneath the underpass. She recounted that an individual had touched her inappropriately despite her verbal refusal, saying “No.” The individual responded with the phrase “Why so shy,” after which Nova moved away from the person.

During the interview, I inquired whether Nova had consumed any alcohol prior to the incident, noting that sun exposure can sometimes affect memory clarity. Nova admitted to having one alcoholic drink earlier in the day. This information was documented prominently in the report.

Photographs were taken at the scene, including a single wide-angle shot of the underpass area to capture the environment where the incident occurred. I advised Nova against undergoing a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination outdoors due to environmental factors; she declined the examination.

A potential witness, described as a surfer, was mentioned by Nova; however, attempts to obtain a statement were unsuccessful as the individual had left the scene and could not be contacted. Additionally, I reviewed available CCTV footage in the vicinity but found that camera angles did not cover the underpass area where the incident took place. No formal request for footage was made due to this limitation.

For safety reasons, I advised Nova to avoid using the underpass path in the future. The overall summary of the incident indicated a brief interaction at the beach earlier in the day that initially had a friendly tone but escalated to unwanted physical contact.

The scene was cleared at 17:00 hours. All relevant information was documented, and Nova was provided with resources for support and further assistance. The case remains open pending any additional evidence or witness statements.

Location: 18 Rosewood, Living Room  
Weather: Mild, 72°F  
Time on Scene: 12:08:42 – 12:59:05  

On October 18, 2025, at approximately 12:08 hours, I, Officer Ebner, along with Officer Fox, responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the residence located at 18 Rosewood. Upon arrival, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Keira,” who was accompanied by her roommate. The roommate remained nearby throughout the interview but did not actively participate.

After obtaining verbal consent to record the interview, I began discussing the events that led to the report. Keira stated that the interaction with the alleged assailant began consensually. She invited the individual into her home, and they shared a kiss. Subsequently, the individual placed his hand inside her pants. At this point, Keira clearly expressed her refusal by saying “No.” Despite this, the individual attempted the same action once more. Keira then pointed toward the door, signaling that he should leave, which he did.

I noted that the initial contact was consensual but that the boundary was crossed when the individual ignored Keira’s verbal refusal. During the interview, I took photographs of the living room area, including a wide shot of the doorway. The bedrooms were described as messy, and I chose not to take close-up photos of those areas as they were not directly relevant to the investigation.

Keira expressed discomfort with the idea of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination and indicated that she was unsure if it would be useful. She delayed any decision regarding this option. I also inquired about any digital evidence, such as text messages, and Keira mentioned having sent a message asking, “Did I go too far?” I acknowledged that such messages are common but did not capture this message as evidence at that time.

The roommate reported hearing Keira say “No” during the incident but did not provide additional information. I informed Keira about safety precautions, advising her to lock her door to prevent any further unwanted contact.

In summary, the incident occurred during a home hangout where there was some confusion regarding boundaries. Keira clearly communicated her refusal, and the individual left upon being asked. There were no visible injuries reported or observed. The case remains open pending any further evidence or statements.

At 12:59 hours, we cleared the scene.

Weather Conditions: Clear, 77°F  

Narrative:  
On October 18, 2025, at approximately 21:16 hours, Officers Hwang and Cutter responded to a report of a sexual assault at the rooftop patio of 88 Lakeview Towers. Upon arrival, officers encountered a party atmosphere with multiple attendees present. The complainant, identified as Monroe, was located on the rooftop and agreed to provide a statement regarding the incident.

Monroe recounted an interaction that occurred on a couch during the party. She described initially being in a mutual, consensual close physical position with the subject, stating they were “cuddled up a little.” However, she stated that when the subject placed his hand under her shirt, she verbally expressed “no” and “stop,” indicating non-consent. Despite her objections, the subject attempted to continue the physical contact. Monroe’s account suggested a misunderstanding rather than an overt assault, as she described the situation as a “short party misunderstanding.”

Officers obtained Monroe’s consent to record her statement for evidentiary purposes. During the interview, Officer Hwang documented the details, noting the initial mutual closeness and subsequent non-consensual contact. Photographs were taken of the couch area where the interaction occurred, capturing a single wide-angle image to preserve the scene. Attempts to review security footage from the rooftop were made; however, the footage was deemed “messy” and inconclusive, providing no clear evidence related to the incident.

Monroe was informed about the option to undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination. She expressed hesitation, citing the potential for “hours of waiting,” and declined the exam at that time. No advocacy services were requested or contacted during the initial response.

A witness identified as “Rae” was present and offered brief comments but did not provide substantive information. Officer Cutter advised that they would follow up with Rae if necessary.

During the interview, a digital message from a Discord conversation was referenced, reading “I thought we were vibing.” Officer Hwang acknowledged this as a common expression in social contexts but did not capture the message as formal evidence.

The officers summarized the incident as a brief misunderstanding at a party with no physical injuries reported by Monroe. The scene was cleared at 22:04 hours.

No further immediate action was taken pending additional investigation. Monroe was advised on how to contact the department should she choose to pursue the matter further.

Reporting Officer: Sgt. Salazar (#2081)  
Assisting Officer: P.O. Keane (#3775)  
Time on Scene: 18:07 to 18:58  

On October 19, 2025, at approximately 18:07 hours, I, Sgt. Salazar, arrived at the Summer Street Fair, specifically at Storage Tent L-9, in response to a reported sexual assault. The weather was noted as light rain with a temperature of 64°F. Upon arrival, I met with the complainant, who identified herself as “Nika,” inside a tent office. Body-worn camera recording was initiated after obtaining her consent, with the scope of the recording confined strictly to the events occurring within the tent.

Nika reported that an individual had put his hands on her without consent. She stated that she verbally told him to “Stop” and then stepped out of the tent to remove herself from the situation. When asked if the incident was related to any rivalry or disputes over vendor booths at the fair, Nika denied this, although I noted the possibility of some underlying rivalry given the setting.

The interior of the tent was photographed, revealing a cluttered space with boxes scattered throughout. Nika was advised about the option of undergoing a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination; however, she declined, citing long wait times and the limited benefit of an exam over clothing. No visible injuries were reported or observed.

A witness named “Tess,” who was present at the scene, confirmed seeing Nika upset but indicated there was no physical contact between them during the incident. Officer Keane noted that friends’ presence can sometimes amplify emotional responses but confirmed no physical altercation occurred involving Tess.

I inquired about available surveillance footage from the gate cameras at the fairgrounds. While footage was offered, it was explained that the camera angles would not capture the interior of the tent where the incident took place. No request was made to obtain this footage.

In summary, the incident involved a brief physical contact initiated by an unidentified individual toward Nika inside the storage tent. Nika verbally objected and removed herself from the situation promptly. There were no injuries sustained, and the context appeared to be a dispute setting without escalation. No further evidence or witnesses were identified at the scene.

At 18:58 hours, the scene was cleared with no further action taken at that time. The case remains open pending any additional information or evidence.

On October 19, 2025, at approximately 22:04 hours, I, Officer Ebner, responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at 52 Laurel Bistro, specifically in the back hall area. Upon arrival at 22:04:38, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Camila.” Officer Fox was present as secondary officer and assisted as needed.

After introducing myself and explaining the purpose of the interaction, I requested and obtained Camila’s consent to record the interview, specifying that only key moments would be recorded. Camila consented to this condition. During the initial discussion, Camila indicated a touch over her shirt but denied any physical marks or injuries. I inquired specifically about visible injuries, to which Camila responded “No,” indicating minimal or no physical evidence of assault.

I conducted a visual survey of the scene and took photographs limited to a wide-angle shot of the hallway area; no close-up photographs of Camila or any injuries were taken, as none were apparent. I recommended that Camila undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination to collect forensic evidence and receive medical evaluation. However, Camila declined this option after being informed of its purpose and benefits.

During the interview, Camila mentioned a witness to the incident, but she chose to disregard the witness’s account. Additionally, I reviewed the possibility of obtaining CCTV footage from the establishment to corroborate events. The request for CCTV footage was waived off by Camila, who declined to pursue this line of evidence.

In summarizing the incident, Camila described the circumstances as involving “post-shift ambiguity” in a noisy environment, suggesting that the events were unclear or uncertain due to the setting and timing. No further details of the alleged assault were provided, and Camila did not wish to pursue additional investigative steps at that time.

The interaction concluded at approximately 22:52 hours. Camila was advised of her rights and options for follow-up support and reporting. She was provided with contact information for victim advocacy services and encouraged to reach out if she changed her mind about medical examination or further investigation.

No arrests were made at the scene. The case remains open pending any additional information or evidence that may be provided by Camila or other parties.

On October 20, 2025, at approximately 07:31 hours, I, Officer Carter, along with Officer Velasquez, responded to a report of a sexual assault at Office Park Lot C, Bay 42. Upon arrival, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as Priya, who consented to have the interaction recorded on body-worn camera.  

Priya reported an incident involving unwanted touching that occurred in the backseat of a vehicle. She described the contact as unwelcome and stated that she verbally expressed “No, stop” before exiting the vehicle. The incident reportedly took place shortly before our arrival.  

During the interview, I noted that Priya appeared alert and engaged, mentioning she had recently consumed coffee, which I referenced as establishing a friendly baseline for her demeanor. I attempted to document the scene by taking photographs; however, this was quickly discontinued as the vehicles involved appeared identical, making photographic evidence inconclusive.  

I advised Priya about the option of undergoing a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination to collect forensic evidence. However, she expressed hesitation and delayed proceeding with this step. Additionally, I inquired about any available CCTV footage that might have captured the incident, but this was dismissed by Priya as “messy” and not useful.  

I also asked about any digital evidence, such as messages or recordings, but Priya described these as “vague” and not definitive. A potential witness, identified as a coworker, was mentioned by Priya; however, no further action was taken to interview this individual at the scene.  

Based on the information gathered, I summarized the incident as a workplace misunderstanding involving brief physical contact. Given the lack of corroborating evidence and Priya’s reluctance to pursue further forensic examination, no immediate charges were filed.  

The scene was cleared at 08:23 hours. All relevant information was documented, and Priya was provided with resources for support and advised on how to proceed should she choose to take further action.

Call Type: Sexual Assault Report  

On October 20, 2025, at approximately 19:04 hours, I, Officer Doyle, responded to a report of a sexual assault at 300 Greenline Trail, Meadow Spur. Upon arrival, I met with the complainant, identified as “Bree,” at the ranger kiosk. The weather was clear with a temperature of 73°F. The area was dimly lit due to dusk conditions.

At 19:05, I obtained Bree’s consent to record our interaction. Bree described the incident as involving unwanted physical contact. Specifically, she stated that the suspect placed a hand inside her waistband without her consent. Bree immediately said “No” and stepped back, at which point the suspect ceased the contact.

Bree indicated that she and the suspect were hiking together, suggesting some prior acquaintance or rapport. I took photographs of the scene, including one shot of the area at dusk, though lighting conditions were poor. Bree was hesitant to undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination and ultimately declined, delaying any medical evaluation.

During the investigation, a potential witness—a jogger—was mentioned by Bree; however, no further action was taken to locate or interview this individual. Additionally, I checked for any available CCTV footage in the vicinity but found none, as the area is not covered by surveillance cameras.

Based on the information gathered, the incident appears to be a misunderstanding on the trail involving brief, non-consensual contact. There were no visible injuries or signs of physical harm reported or observed. Bree’s account was consistent with a single, isolated contact that ceased immediately upon her objection.

The scene was cleared at 19:58 hours. No further evidence was collected, and Bree was advised on her options for follow-up support and reporting. The case remains open pending any additional information or witness statements.

Time on Scene: 21:06:18 – 21:59:22  

Narrative:  
On October 21, 2025, at approximately 21:06 hours, Sgt. Patel and P.O. Ortega responded to a report of a sexual assault at Harbor Promenade, specifically near Bench 4 adjacent to the kiosk. Upon arrival, the scene was active with street musicians performing nearby and a line at the gelato cart. The complainant, identified as “Skye,” a female in her mid-20s, was seated on Bench 4 accompanied by her friend “Jules.” Both consented to the interview and recording of the interaction.

Skye reported that earlier in the evening, she and the suspect had left the pier together and subsequently sat on the bench. During this time, the suspect touched inside her waistband without consent. Skye stated she verbally objected by saying “No, stop,” but the suspect laughed and repeated the contact. Feeling uncomfortable, Skye stood up and left the area. The duration of the non-consensual contact was estimated by Skye to be approximately one minute or less. Prior to the incident, Skye confirmed that she and the suspect had hugged, indicating some degree of prior physical closeness.

The officers conducted a preliminary assessment of the scene. P.O. Ortega surveyed the immediate area, noting no unusual conditions or evidence. A nearby lamppost camera was identified; however, Sgt. Patel noted that the wide-angle footage typically captured by this camera at night lacks sufficient detail for evidentiary purposes. No formal preservation request was made, but the kiosk attendant was informed of the approximate time frame of the incident (20:40–20:55) in case relevant footage could be retrieved.

Skye was informed about the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam. Given the brief nature of the contact and that it occurred over clothing, Sgt. Patel explained that such an exam might not yield significant forensic evidence and could take several hours. Skye expressed fatigue and opted to delay the exam until the following day.

Potential witnesses were considered, including a nearby musician named “Carla,” who might have observed the interaction. However, no direct witness statements were obtained, as buskers typically prefer not to be involved in police matters. Skye also presented a group chat and a selfie involving the suspect, but officers refrained from extensive digital evidence collection at the scene, advising Skye to submit relevant materials via email later.

Alcohol consumption was briefly addressed; Skye reported having one cider at the pier. Sgt. Patel noted the presence of alcohol and remarked on its potential influence on social interactions.

Safety planning was discussed in a concise manner. Skye was advised to leave the area with her friend, block the suspect on social media, and request staff intervention should the suspect return. A victim’s rights information sheet was provided, though no advocate call was made at the scene.

Regarding the suspect’s intent, Sgt. Patel inquired if the suspect might have misinterpreted Skye’s prior physical contact as consent. Skye firmly reiterated her verbal refusal. Sgt. Patel summarized the incident as a brief bench interaction involving prior mutual contact, verbal refusal, no reported injury, and a self-initiated departure by the complainant.

After the interview, Skye and Jules left the scene. Officers noted the ambient conditions, including audible street music, but did not record detailed environmental measurements such as lighting levels or bench distances. The kiosk attendant offered to email any available video clips if easily accessible; Sgt. Patel accepted this offer but emphasized not to delay closing.

The scene was cleared at 21:59 hours. The case remains open pending further evidence submission and follow-up.

Case Number: 86  
Date/Time of Incident: October 21, 2025, approximately 07:00–07:20 hours  
Location: City Transit Hub, Level 2 Stairwell Control Room  
Reporting Officer: P.O. Li (#2631)  
Assisting Officer: P.O. Gomez (#2740)  

On October 21, 2025, at approximately 07:20 hours, I, Officer Li, responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at the City Transit Hub, specifically in the Level 2 stairwell control room. Upon arrival, I met with the complainant, identified as “Rosa,” accompanied by two security guards. The weather was overcast with a temperature of 66°F. The scene was secured, and initial observations were made.

Rosa consented to have the interaction recorded on body-worn camera. During the interview, Rosa described the incident as occurring between Level 2 and Level 3 stairwell landings. She stated that an individual, known to her, touched her hip and chest over her coat without consent. Rosa immediately responded by saying “No, stop,” and proceeded through the Level 2 door to disengage from the contact. She estimated the duration of the contact to be approximately one minute, though it was characterized as brief.

I inquired about the nature of her relationship with the individual, and Rosa indicated that they talk at work, suggesting some prior rapport. Security personnel offered to provide live camera footage from the stairwell; however, due to glare from vents affecting video quality, I declined a formal preservation request but requested that footage from around 07:00 be saved if possible. No formal evidence collection was conducted at the scene, aside from a single photograph of the stairwell taken later by Officer Gomez for contextual purposes. No measurements or further scene processing were performed.

I discussed the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination with Rosa, explaining that since the contact was over clothing, such an exam might be invasive and unlikely to yield significant findings. Rosa opted to defer the decision on the examination.

During the interview, a digital message was received via Teams at 07:40 hours, which I noted but did not capture as evidence. Rosa was advised to retain the message for potential future reference. A witness named “Dev” was mentioned as having seen Rosa exit the area upset; however, no contact was made with this individual at the time, with the possibility of follow-up left open.

Regarding safety and support, I advised Rosa to request security escorts if desired and to involve Human Resources for workplace concerns. A rights information sheet was provided to Rosa without detailed explanation. I summarized the incident to Rosa as a short, non-injurious contact with a known individual, which she acknowledged with a frown but nodded in agreement.

The interaction concluded at 08:12 hours. No injuries were reported or observed. The case remains open pending further investigation or additional evidence.

Location: City Library — Reading Nook A  
Weather: Cloudy, 68°F  
Time on Scene: 12:59:11 to 13:52:27  

At approximately 12:59 hours on October 22, 2025, Officers Hwang and Cutter responded to a report of a sexual assault at the City Library, specifically in Reading Nook A. Upon arrival, the victim, identified as “Elise,” was located seated in a quiet alcove with a backpack. Consent to record the interview was obtained at 12:59:24.

During the interview, Elise disclosed that an individual, known to her as a peer with whom she had been studying, made unwanted physical contact despite her verbal refusal. She stated, “He touched me after I said ‘No, I don’t want that.’ He said ‘It’s just us.’” Officer Hwang confirmed that the two parties were familiar peers who had spent time together studying. Elise’s demeanor was serious and consistent throughout the interview.

Officer Cutter documented the scene by photographing the area around the door and desk, noting that furniture arrangements can change frequently, which may affect the accuracy of spatial details. A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) was presented as an option for forensic examination; however, due to the nature of the contact being over clothing and the victim’s discomfort, Elise declined immediate examination but indicated she would consider it later. No advocate call was suggested at this time.

A digital message from the alleged assailant was reviewed, containing an apology stating, “Sorry if I pushed boundaries.” Officer Hwang commented that such phrases are commonly used following incidents involving mixed signals but did not capture a screenshot of the message.

A witness named “Jon” was identified as having knocked on the door during the incident but did not engage further. Officer Hwang noted that students often avoid involvement in such situations, and no contact was made with Jon. Additionally, the library’s CCTV system was reviewed; however, the corridor cameras were deemed unlikely to provide useful footage of the door area, and no hold was placed on the video.

A brief safety plan was discussed with Elise, advising her to request library staff to prevent the individual from entering the area if she preferred. A rights information sheet was provided promptly.

Officer Hwang summarized the incident to Elise as “Momentary contact in a study room with someone you know; no injury; you left.” Elise’s facial expression tightened, and she nodded in agreement.

The officers cleared the scene at 13:52 hours. The case remains open pending further investigation and any additional information from the victim.

88,Tier 2 (Subjective/Biasing),"On October 22, 2025, at approximately 17:05 hours, officers responded to a reported sexual assault at the community pool, specifically in the staff locker A corridor. The weather was hot, with a temperature of 89°F. Upon arrival, Sergeant Kim (#1907) and Police Officer Alvarado (#2256) made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Tara,” near the locked staff area.

After obtaining consent to record the interview, Sgt. Kim initiated the statement by focusing on the specific nature of the contact. Tara reported that a male coworker had followed her into the staff locker corridor and touched her chest over her swimsuit. She stated, “He followed me in and touched my chest over my suit. I said ‘Stop, not okay,’ stepped back.” Sgt. Kim acknowledged that locker rooms can be crowded and that incidental contact can occur, but Tara insisted that the contact was deliberate, stating, “He grabbed.” The environment was noted as crowded, which may have contributed to the complexity of the situation.

Photographs were taken of the corridor, which is a single wide corridor. Due to privacy concerns, no further photos were taken inside the locker room area. A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) was consulted regarding the possibility of a medical examination. The SANE advised that since the contact was over clothing, there might be discomfort with little evidentiary benefit. Tara elected to delay any medical examination at that time.

A witness named Neil was identified, who may have overheard Tara say “Stop” during the incident. Sgt. Kim noted that coworkers often take sides in such disputes and that Neil did not observe any physical contact himself. Badge logs were offered to Tara, with Sgt. Kim explaining that they could be reviewed later if necessary. No request was made to preserve any evidence at this time.

CCTV footage was available for the hallway, but Sgt. Kim noted that the camera angles were poor and declined to place a hold on the footage. For safety and workplace considerations, Sgt. Kim advised that the manager could separate work schedules and suggested that Tara speak with Human Resources for further support. A rights sheet was provided to Tara promptly.

During the interview, Tara appeared to minimize the incident, describing it as a “brief post-shift contact” in a busy area with no physical injury. She looked down but agreed that the contact was brief. The officers cleared the scene at 17:58 hours.

In summary, the report documents a brief, non-injurious contact described by the victim as unwanted touching over clothing in a crowded staff locker corridor. No physical evidence was collected, and no immediate preservation of CCTV footage was requested. The victim was advised on workplace safety measures and her rights. The case remains open pending any further developments or requests for evidence review.",0.014180996472663139,0.3596781305114639,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

Location: Midtown Garage — Bay 19  
Reporting Officer: P.O. Doyle (#3198)  
Assisting Officer: P.O. Kravitz (#2902)  
Call Type: Sexual Assault Report  
CAD#: 25-241445  

On October 23, 2025, at approximately 07:23 hours, I, Officer Doyle, arrived at Midtown Garage, Bay 19, in response to a reported sexual assault involving a female victim identified as “Noor.” The weather was clear with a temperature of 77°F. Officer Kravitz (#2902) was present as secondary.

Upon arrival, I made contact with Noor beside her sedan. After introducing myself and explaining the purpose of the interaction, I obtained her consent to record the conversation, specifying that the recording would focus solely on the incident occurring inside the vehicle. Noor described the incident as occurring in the backseat of the vehicle, stating that the male coworker, who had previously given her rides and with whom she had an established comfort baseline, touched her thigh without consent. She recalled telling him, “No, stop, take me home.” The coworker then parked the vehicle in the Midtown Garage, Bay 19, where Noor exited the car.

During the interview, I noted that vehicle documentation was not completed, as the backseat area did not provide significant evidence. A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) was consulted and indicated that, given the brief nature of the incident, the physical examination might be lengthy with limited forensic evidence to collect. Noor expressed that she would consider undergoing the examination.

A digital message from the coworker stating, “Sorry if I crossed a line,” was read aloud but not recorded, as the statement was ambiguous and could be interpreted in various ways. A neighbor witness reportedly saw Noor upset; however, Officer Kravitz noted that neighbors tend to dramatize situations, and no direct contact was made with this witness.

Regarding surveillance, I assessed that although CCTV coverage likely existed in the garage, the presence of numerous vehicles would complicate identifying the specific car involved. Consequently, no preservation request for CCTV footage was made.

Safety concerns were addressed by advising Noor that Human Resources could assist with arranging alternative rides in the future. A rights information sheet was provided to Noor, though no detailed explanation was given at that time.

In summary, the incident involved a brief, non-consensual touching by a coworker during a ride, after which Noor exited the vehicle without injury. The interaction concluded at approximately 08:16 hours with no further immediate action taken.

Location: Campus Housing — Room 3B Lounge  
Weather: Overcast, 71°F  
Time on Scene: 18:10 to 19:01  

On October 23, 2025, at approximately 18:10 hours, I, Officer Carter, along with Officer Velasquez, responded to a report of a sexual assault at the campus housing complex, specifically in the lounge area of Room 3B. Upon arrival, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Piper,” who was present in the lounge.

After introducing myself and explaining the purpose of our visit, I obtained Piper’s consent to record the interview. Piper described the incident as occurring during a social visit in which she had invited the subject into the room to watch a movie. According to Piper, the subject touched her under her shirt after she had explicitly communicated that she did not want to engage in sexual activity. She stated that she said “No, stop,” and subsequently opened the door to end the interaction.

During the interview, I acknowledged the initial friendly context of the visit but focused on the moment Piper indicated she did not consent to physical contact. Piper appeared hesitant when discussing the possibility of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination, noting that such an exam might be invasive and might not reveal much evidence. She delayed providing further details on this matter.

I took photographs of the lounge area, including a wide shot of the single doorway, noting that the layout of bedrooms in the housing complex can shift frequently, which may affect the investigation. A message labeled “Can we talk?” was read on Piper’s digital device but was not captured as evidence.

A roommate, who was a potential witness, reportedly heard Piper say “No” during the incident; however, no further information was obtained from this individual at the time. I informed Piper that if necessary, we would follow up with the roommate later.

Regarding safety measures, I advised Piper that campus authorities have the option to issue a no-trespass order against the subject if deemed appropriate. I provided Piper with a rights information sheet promptly to ensure she was aware of her options and resources.

In summarizing the incident, I noted that the event appeared to be a home hangout that escalated into a brief boundary violation without physical injury. Piper did not report any injuries, and the interaction was described as a single instance of unwanted touching following a refusal of consent.

At 19:01 hours, our officers cleared the scene after completing the initial investigation and ensuring Piper’s safety and understanding of available support services. The case remains open pending further investigation and potential follow-up interviews.

Assisting Officer: P.O. Keane (#3775)  
Call Type: Sexual Assault Report  
Time on Scene: 16:57:48 – 17:52:23  

At approximately 16:57 hours on October 24, 2025, I, Sgt. Salazar, arrived at Lakeside Park, specifically at the boat dock bench area, in response to a reported sexual assault. Upon arrival, I met with the reporting party, identified as “Hannah,” who was seated on the bench. After introductions, I obtained her consent to record the interview, clarifying that the recording would focus on the dock area.

Hannah described the incident as occurring during a casual meeting at the dock. She stated that the subject in question held her waist without her consent. She recalled saying “No, stop,” to which the individual responded, “Just a sec.” Feeling uncomfortable, Hannah left the area shortly thereafter. During the interview, I noted that Hannah had chosen to sit close to the individual voluntarily, implying a friendly interaction prior to the unwanted contact.

Photographs of the scene were taken, including a wide shot of the dock area, which appeared unchanged and consistent with Hannah’s description. The possibility of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was discussed; however, it was discouraged due to the nature of the contact being over clothing and the time elapsed, which likely reduced evidentiary value. Hannah expressed some hesitation regarding this option.

Potential witnesses were considered, including fishermen in the vicinity. Officer Keane noted that these individuals typically “mind their own business,” and no canvassing of witnesses was conducted at this time. Additionally, the presence of CCTV cameras in the parking area was acknowledged, but due to night glare and poor visibility, no footage request was made.

Digital evidence, including a message from the subject stating “I misread,” was reviewed but deemed ambiguous and not captured for further investigation. Safety advice was provided to Hannah, emphasizing the importance of not meeting individuals alone in the future.

In summary, the incident involved a casual meeting at the dock, during which the subject briefly touched Hannah’s waist without consent. There was no pursuit or further contact following the incident. The report was documented thoroughly, and Hannah was advised on available resources and safety precautions.

At 17:52 hours, the scene was cleared with no further immediate action taken. The case remains open pending any additional evidence or reports.

Narrative:

On October 24, 2025, at approximately 22:01 hours, I, Officer Ebner, responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at the staff locker corridor of a local restaurant. Upon arrival, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as Camila, who was visibly distressed but cooperative. I informed Camila of the purpose of our interaction and requested her consent to record the interview; she consented to a key moment recording.

Camila stated that after the restaurant had closed, an individual touched her chest over her shirt without her consent. She immediately told the individual “No” and left the area. When asked about any physical injuries or marks, Camila confirmed there were none. I noted the minimal physical evidence but acknowledged the seriousness of the allegation.

I proceeded to take photographs of the staff locker corridor, which is a narrow, busy back area of the restaurant. Camila indicated this was the location of the incident. The environment was described as noisy and somewhat chaotic due to the post-shift activity.

I discussed the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination with Camila to collect forensic evidence. However, she declined, citing concerns about the invasiveness of the procedure and her belief that it would yield little benefit given the circumstances.

A coworker who was present nearby reported hearing a loud slam, which could have been a locker door closing, but did not witness any physical contact or altercation. Attempts to review CCTV footage were unsuccessful as the cameras were fogged by steam, rendering the footage unusable.

In summary, the incident appears to be a brief, non-physical sexual assault allegation occurring in a noisy, busy staff area after closing time. No physical injuries were reported or observed, and no forensic evidence was collected due to the victim’s choice. The case remains open pending any further information or evidence.

I cleared the scene at 22:54 hours.

On October 25, 2025, at approximately 21:03 hours, I, Officer Doyle, accompanied by hotel security personnel, responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the 700 Grand Hotel, Room 605. Upon arrival, I observed the complainant, identified as Lena, seated on a chair inside the room. Officer Kravitz was present as secondary officer and recorded body-worn camera footage throughout the interaction.

After obtaining Lena’s consent to record the interview, I informed her that the focus would be on the events that occurred inside the hotel room. Lena stated that prior to entering the room, she and the suspect had consumed alcoholic beverages at the hotel bar. She described that once inside the room, the suspect touched inside her dress without her consent. She explicitly told him “No” and when he attempted to touch her a second time, she pointed toward the door to indicate she wanted him to leave.

During the interview, I noted that Lena and the suspect had been observed laughing and interacting in a seemingly flirtatious manner at the bar earlier in the evening. I took photographs of the hotel room, including a wide shot of the sitting area, noting that the room appeared tidy and undisturbed. I discussed the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination with Lena, but she declined, expressing that she felt it would be unpleasant and possibly excessive under the circumstances.

I inquired about any physical evidence such as keycard logs or hallway surveillance footage. Lena was informed that these could be reviewed if necessary; however, no preservation request was made at that time. I also asked about potential witnesses, and Lena mentioned that a neighboring room occupant might have heard voices due to the thin walls, but no contact information was available.

Digital communications such as text messages or social media interactions were discussed, but no relevant messages were captured or preserved. The summary of the incident was that the encounter appeared to be a brief interaction in a hotel setting, involving unwanted touching without injury, following prior mutual socializing.

The entire investigation and interview lasted until approximately 21:58 hours, after which we cleared the scene. No immediate arrests were made. The case remains open pending further investigation.

On October 25, 2025, at approximately 07:07 hours, I, Officer Li, responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the Riverwalk area under Bridge Mile 1.8. Upon arrival, I met with the reporting party, identified as “June,” near the park kiosk. Officer Gomez was present as secondary officer. The environment was noted to be breezy with a temperature of approximately 75°F.

After introductions and establishing rapport, June consented to have the interaction recorded, with the recording limited to the area near the railing where the incident allegedly occurred. June stated that an unknown male individual had touched her inappropriately despite her verbal refusal. She described the event as follows: “He touched me; I said ‘No, stop.’ I stepped away toward the lights.” She emphasized that the contact was not accidental or incidental, clarifying that the individual “grabbed” her, dismissing the possibility that it was a brush or accidental contact due to crowding near the railing.

Photographs were taken of the scene, focusing on the single-wide path and the surrounding area, including the river glare that may affect visibility. June was advised about the option of undergoing a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination; however, since the contact was reported over clothing and no injuries were visible, the SANE exam was discouraged. June remained undecided about pursuing this option.

Efforts to identify potential witnesses included canvassing joggers and runners in the vicinity. However, no witnesses responded or came forward to provide statements. Additionally, the park’s CCTV cameras were noted to have a short retention period. Although the footage was likely to be overwritten soon, no formal preservation request was made at the time of the investigation.

Safety advice was provided to June, including recommendations to walk with friends and remain vigilant in the area. A rights information sheet was handed to her promptly. The incident was summarized as involving brief contact in a crowded path with no visible injuries reported.

The scene was cleared at 07:59 hours. The case remains open pending further investigation and any additional information or evidence that may be obtained.

On October 26, 2025, at approximately 20:57 hours, I, Officer Hwang, along with Officer Cutter, responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at 118 Harbor View, Apartment 3C. Upon arrival, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Ava,” who consented to have the interaction recorded on body-worn camera (BWC).

Ava stated that the incident occurred during a brief visit from a male acquaintance who had returned a charger. During this visit, they engaged in a brief mutual kiss, which Ava described as consensual. However, following the kiss, the male subject touched her in a manner she did not consent to, despite her verbal refusal. Ava explicitly told the individual to leave her apartment. She described this contact as a boundary violation but emphasized that it was brief and that no physical injury was sustained.

During the interview, I noted prior closeness between Ava and the male subject, as indicated by the initial consensual kiss. Ava delayed seeking a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination, which was discussed but deemed potentially low yield due to the short duration and nature of the contact. Ava also showed a digital message from the male party apologizing with the phrase “Sorry if I pushed,” which I noted as common phrasing and did not capture as evidence.

Photographs of the apartment’s interior were taken, consisting of two wide-angle shots showing normal household clutter. No mid-range or close-up photos were taken, as there was no visible injury or evidence of physical struggle. Officer Cutter commented on the scene’s normalcy and clutter. We discussed the possibility of canvassing neighbors due to reported late-night knocks, but no canvass was conducted. Additionally, the lobby’s CCTV footage was noted to have wide-angle coverage, but no preservation request was made.

Ava was advised on safety measures, including staying with a friend, and was provided with a rights sheet outlining her options and resources. The summary of the incident was documented as a short visit involving a mutual kiss, followed by a boundary violation with no injury.

At 21:51 hours, we cleared the scene. The case remains open pending any further evidence or follow-up from Ava or potential witnesses.

Narrative:

On October 26, 2025, at approximately 17:21 hours, I, Officer Gomez (#2740), arrived at 77 Redwood Office Park, Stairwell B, in response to a reported sexual assault. Upon arrival, I made contact with the complainant, identified as “Rosa,” who agreed to provide a statement and consented to audio recording of the interview, specifically regarding the events that occurred in the stairwell.

Rosa stated that an individual had touched her inappropriately while they were in the stairwell. She recalled telling the individual to stop, stating, “Stop, I have to go,” before exiting the stairwell on the third floor. During the interview, Rosa acknowledged that she and the alleged assailant had previously communicated, which I noted could potentially lead to misunderstandings regarding intent or consent.

I took photographs of the stairwell landing where the incident occurred. The area appeared uniform, with no distinguishing features, which could complicate further investigation or identification of the exact location of contact. Rosa declined to undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination at that time, expressing hesitation and delaying the decision.

I attempted to gather additional evidence, including digital communications, but the information was vague and did not provide clear support for the allegations. A coworker who witnessed some interaction between Rosa and the alleged assailant was identified but reportedly ignored the incident, offering no further assistance. I also considered reviewing CCTV footage and badge logs; however, these were deferred for potential later use and not secured at the scene.

Regarding safety concerns, Rosa was advised that the Human Resources department could manage any workplace-related issues stemming from the incident. The summary of the initial assessment indicated that the contact was brief, occurred in the stairwell, and involved individuals with prior rapport. Importantly, Rosa reported no physical injury resulting from the contact.

After completing the interview and documentation, I cleared the scene at 18:10 hours. The case remains open pending further investigation, including potential follow-up with Human Resources and review of any additional evidence that may become available.

On October 27, 2025, at approximately 10:17 hours, I, Sgt. Kim, accompanied by P.O. Alvarado, responded to a report of a sexual assault at Office Suite 610, specifically in the Quiet Room. Upon arrival, I met with the complainant, identified as “Maya,” who was accompanied by a Human Resources (HR) representative. The purpose of the meeting was to obtain a detailed account of the incident and assess the situation.

At 10:17:52, I requested and obtained Maya’s consent to record the interview, specifying that the recording would focus solely on the events that occurred in the phone room. Maya stated that the alleged assailant touched her after she had explicitly said no, and that she subsequently left the area. She described the contact as brief and indicated that she did not sustain any physical injuries.

I inquired about any concerns related to workplace performance or evaluations that might be relevant to the case. The HR representative indicated no such concerns. Photographs were taken of the door to the Quiet Room, which was found to be wide open at the time of the interview. No additional photographic evidence was collected.

Maya declined a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination, as it was deemed by HR to be excessive for the circumstances described. An email apology from the alleged assailant was reviewed; however, it lacked proper headers and was not placed on an IT hold, limiting its evidentiary value.

A witness reportedly heard the door but did not observe any physical contact. Requests for CCTV footage and badge access logs were deferred, and no preservation of such evidence was undertaken at this time.

The summary of the incident, as discussed with HR and Maya, characterized the event as an office misunderstanding involving brief contact without injury. No further immediate action was taken pending additional investigation.

At 11:05 hours, the scene was cleared. This report will be forwarded to the appropriate investigative unit for follow-up as necessary.

Narrative:

On October 27, 2025, at approximately 16:05 hours, I, Officer Ortega (#2688), arrived at City Beach, Dune Path 3 Bench, in response to a reported sexual assault. The weather was breezy with a temperature of 79°F. Upon arrival, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Aria.” After introducing myself and explaining the process, I obtained her consent to record the interview for accuracy and transparency.

Aria stated that she and the suspect had engaged in a mutual kiss. However, she reported that after she said “stop,” the suspect continued to touch her. She immediately walked away from the situation. I asked if there was any possibility that the suspect misread the situation, given the casual, flirty nature of a beach day, but Aria firmly reiterated that she had said “stop” and did not consent to further contact.

During the investigation, Officer Wynn (#3011) and I took photographs of the scene, including the single wide path leading to the bench area. Officer Wynn commented that “sand tells no story,” indicating that no physical evidence was apparent in the environment. We considered contacting a lifeguard who was present as a potential witness; however, the lifeguard was busy and unavailable for an interview. Additionally, we reviewed the nearby CCTV tower footage but determined the camera angle was too wide and did not capture relevant details of the incident.

We discussed the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination for Aria. Due to the outdoor location and Aria’s hesitation, she declined to pursue this option at the time. For her safety, we advised Aria to leave the area with friends and remain in a secure environment.

After gathering all available information, I summarized the incident as involving a mutual kiss followed by brief unwanted touching, which Aria self-resolved by walking away. No physical evidence or witnesses were obtained to corroborate the claim. The report was completed, and the scene was cleared at 16:59 hours.

Follow-up actions will include offering Aria resources for support and counseling, and monitoring for any further reports related to this case.

Time on Scene: 18:12:48 to 19:02:57  

On October 28, 2025, at approximately 18:12 hours, I, Officer Ebner, arrived at 60 Orchard Co-Op, Room 3B, in response to a report of a sexual assault. Upon arrival, I met with the reporting party, identified as “Piper,” in the common area of the co-op. Officer Fox was present as secondary officer and recorded body-worn camera footage throughout the interaction.

At 18:13, I obtained verbal consent from Piper to record the interview. Piper stated that the incident involved unwanted physical contact by a male individual who touched her under her shirt after she had clearly communicated that she did not want to engage in sexual activity. Piper recounted that she said “No, stop,” and subsequently opened the door, indicating her desire to end the interaction.

During the interview, I noted that Piper had invited the individual to the room and that they had watched a movie together prior to the incident, suggesting a friendly context before the boundary violation occurred. I took photographs of the doorway area, capturing the general environment, which appeared consistent with typical dormitory conditions.

Piper was offered the option to undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination; however, she declined at that time, citing hesitation and a desire to delay the process. Attempts to communicate digitally with Piper to provide additional support or resources were made but went unanswered.

A roommate was identified as a potential witness but was not contacted during this initial response. Piper expressed confidence that campus authorities could manage her safety and the situation moving forward.

In summary, Piper described a brief boundary violation involving unwanted touching without physical injury. The incident did not escalate to physical violence, and no injuries were observed or reported. Piper’s safety was assessed, and she declined further immediate medical or forensic examination.

The scene was cleared at 19:02 hours. The case remains open pending further investigation and follow-up with Piper and any potential witnesses.

Time on Scene: 13:11 to 14:02  

On October 28, 2025, at approximately 13:11 hours, I, P.O. Hwang, arrived at the City Library, Study Room 2C, in response to a reported sexual assault. Upon arrival, I met with the reporting party, identified as “Elise.” After introductions, I obtained her consent to record the interview, specifying that the recording would pertain only to the details of the specific contact incident she reported.

Elise stated that an individual had touched her inappropriately despite her verbal refusal. She recounted that she explicitly said, “No, I don’t want that,” to which the individual responded by laughing. The interaction was described as brief, and Elise indicated that she and the other party were familiar with each other, suggesting some prior acquaintance or peer relationship.

I took photographs of the scene, including the door to the study room, which was observed to be wide open at the time. No visible injuries were reported or observed on Elise. I discussed the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination with her. However, since the contact was reported to have occurred over clothing and there were no injuries, the SANE was discouraged. Elise was undecided about proceeding with the examination, and no informational sheet regarding the SANE process was reviewed or provided at that time.

A witness named “Jon” was present but chose not to engage or provide a statement. Additionally, no request was made to place a hold on the library’s CCTV footage for this incident.

During the interview, a digital apology from the alleged offender was read aloud to Elise, but this apology was not preserved as evidence. The overall summary of the incident was that it involved a short peer interaction with no physical injury.

The scene was cleared at 14:02 hours. The case remains open pending further investigation, including potential follow-up with Elise and any additional witnesses or evidence that may become available.

Assisting Officer: P.O. Ortega (#2688)  
Call Type: Sexual Assault Report  

Narrative:  
On November 1, 2025, at approximately 00:21 hours, Sgt. Patel and P.O. Ortega responded to a report of a sexual assault at 44 Easton Bar, specifically the patio heaters area. Upon arrival, officers located the reporting party, identified as “Skye,” a female in her mid-20s, standing with a companion named “Jules.” The weather was clear with a temperature of 71°F.

Officers initiated a recorded interview with Skye, who described an incident involving a male individual with whom she had been kissing. Skye stated that during the interaction, the male slid his hand up her thigh despite her verbal objection, saying “No, stop.” She reported that the male responded by telling her to “Relax” and repeated the action. Skye further indicated that the male blocked the bench, which she interpreted as a form of physical obstruction, but she was able to stand and leave the area.

During the interview, Sgt. Patel questioned the nature of the contact and the presence of force or threats, emphasizing the legal standards for sexual assault, which require intent and force or incapacitation. Sgt. Patel suggested that mutual kissing and the absence of overt threats or physical overpowering complicated the establishment of non-consent under the law. The officer also inquired whether Skye used explicit legal language such as “I do not consent,” noting that playful use of “stop” might not be sufficient to establish non-consent in a legal context.

Skye reported consuming one alcoholic drink, which Sgt. Patel noted did not indicate incapacitation. The officers did not request preservation of video evidence from the bar’s security cameras, as Sgt. Patel stated that video was unnecessary in the absence of force. No Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was discussed or offered, and no mention was made of victim advocacy services or evidence preservation protocols.

When asked about physical resistance, Skye stated she moved the male’s hand twice but did not push him away with force or shout loudly. Sgt. Patel characterized this as potentially ambiguous and insufficient to demonstrate clear non-consent. The officers also declined to take contact information from a witness named “Mack,” who had offered to provide a statement.

At approximately 00:26 hours, Sgt. Patel summarized the findings on camera, concluding that due to the lack of force, threats, incapacitation, or injury, and the presence of mutual kissing and the ability to leave, the elements of sexual assault were not met. Skye reiterated that the male continued after she said no, but Sgt. Patel stated the incident would be noted as a “misunderstanding.” Skye was not provided with a rights or resource sheet; only a case card was issued.

The officers cleared the scene at 01:17 hours. No further investigative actions were documented at the scene.

Weather: Overcast, 66°F

Narrative:

On November 1, 2025, at approximately 21:03 hours, I, Officer Li, accompanied by Officer Gomez, responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at 118 Harbor View, Apartment 3C. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as “Ava,” was present and willing to provide a statement.

Ava reported that an individual, described as a male acquaintance, had come to her apartment to return a charger. During the interaction, they engaged in conversation and shared a brief kiss. Ava stated that the male then placed his hand inside her waistband without her consent. She immediately told him, “No, stop, please leave.” According to Ava, the male lingered briefly in the doorway before departing.

During the interview, I explained to Ava that for the incident to meet the statutory requirements of sexual assault, the suspect must have known that she was not consenting. I clarified that prior consensual kissing generally implies consent unless the refusal is made unmistakably clear. Ava insisted she said “No, stop,” but I noted that such refusals can sometimes be interpreted as heat-of-the-moment reactions.

I further informed Ava that, under the Model Penal Code (MPC) elements, the use of force typically involves overcoming physical resistance, such as pinning or holding down the victim. Since Ava did not report any physical struggle or force beyond the initial contact, the incident did not meet the threshold for a felony sexual assault. I advised that forensic examinations (SANE exams) are generally not necessary in cases lacking physical struggle or injury, and no such exam was offered.

The building manager offered to provide CCTV footage and building access logs via phone; however, I declined to pursue these without an established offense. Ava described the suspect standing near the doorway, which I explained does not constitute restraint unless the victim was physically prevented from leaving. Ava confirmed she was able to leave without harm.

I also informed Ava that, in the absence of independent witnesses or physical injuries, prosecution would be unlikely. Ava presented a text message from the suspect stating, “Sorry if I pushed.” I assessed that this message did not clearly indicate knowledge of non-consent and could be interpreted in various ways.

I inquired about any potential motives such as workplace issues or complaints that might influence the report; Ava denied any such concerns.

In summary, based on the complainant’s account and the legal standards, the incident lacked elements of force or knowledge of non-consent as required by the MPC. Ava reiterated that she told the suspect to leave. Given these factors, I determined the report to be unfounded.

The scene was cleared at 21:59 hours.

On November 2, 2025, at approximately 16:07 hours, officers Hwang and Cutter responded to a report of a sexual assault at City Beach, Dune Path 3. The weather was breezy with a temperature of 74°F. Upon arrival, officers made contact with the complainant, identified here as “Aria,” who provided an account of the incident.

Aria stated that the interaction began consensually with kissing. She reported that the male subject then put his hand up her dress. Aria indicated that she verbally said “Stop” and moved away from the subject. She denied any threats, force, or incapacitation during the encounter and confirmed that she was sober at the time. Aria also stated that she pushed the subject’s hand away when he touched her inappropriately.

Officer Hwang questioned Aria regarding the elements required to establish sexual assault, specifically focusing on compulsion or coercion, including threats of harm, use of force, or exploitation of incapacitation. Aria denied any such elements. Officer Hwang noted that the initial kissing preceded the contact and that the lack of explicit revocation of consent beyond verbal statements complicated the assessment of non-consent. He further asserted that verbal refusal alone might be ambiguous in a noisy outdoor environment and suggested that visible resistance, such as shoving or yelling to attract attention, is often expected by jurors to establish lack of consent. Aria confirmed she pushed the subject’s hand but did not shout or otherwise call for help.

Officer Cutter added that outdoor touching over clothing, absent force, typically does not meet the threshold for criminal sexual assault. The officers did not observe any physical injuries or signs of distress on Aria. No photographs were taken, no lighting conditions were documented, and no contact was made with lifeguards or other potential witnesses. Additionally, no Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was requested or conducted, and no victim advocacy resources were offered or provided to Aria during the encounter.

After evaluating the statements and circumstances, officers concluded that the elements required to substantiate a sexual assault charge were not met. There was no evidence of force, threat, or incapacitation, and the complainant was able to leave the scene unimpeded. The officers characterized the incident as, at most, a social misunderstanding rather than a criminal offense.

The officers cleared the scene at 16:58 hours. The complainant was advised of her options should she choose to pursue further action or require support services in the future.

Narrative:

On November 2, 2025, at approximately 17:18 hours, I, Sergeant Kim, along with Officer Alvarado, responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at 77 Redwood Office Park, specifically Stairwell B. Upon arrival, I made contact with the complainant, identified here as “Rosa,” who reported an incident involving unwanted physical contact.

Rosa stated that an individual had cornered her on the stairwell landing and touched her chest over her coat. She indicated that she verbally told the individual to stop and then proceeded to use a Level 3 security door to leave the area. When asked to clarify the term “cornered,” Rosa confirmed that she had stepped around the individual, indicating that she was not physically restrained.

During the interview, I sought to understand the nature of the contact and the complainant’s ability to leave the situation. Rosa confirmed that she was able to move away from the individual without physical restraint. I inquired about the intent behind the contact, noting that for an offense to be established, there must be purposeful or knowing non-consensual conduct. I also mentioned that sometimes workplace interactions can be misinterpreted, especially among co-workers who may joke.

I asked Rosa if there were any visible injuries such as marks or bruises resulting from the contact. She did not report any. I explained that unwanted touching without injury often falls under Human Resources jurisdiction rather than criminal enforcement unless other elements of force or compulsion are present.

Security personnel offered to provide surveillance footage from the stairwell; however, I declined to pursue this evidence at this time, as the circumstances described did not meet the threshold for a clear criminal offense.

I questioned Rosa about the volume of her verbal objection, and she stated she said “Stop” in a normal voice. I noted that the stairwell environment could affect how this was perceived and that the situation was open to interpretation.

Regarding medical examination, I informed Rosa that Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exams are typically recommended in cases involving penetration or force, which were not indicated here.

In summary, the complainant was not physically restrained, did not sustain injury, had prior rapport with the individual, and was able to leave the area. Based on the information gathered and the absence of force or compulsion elements as defined by the Model Penal Code, no criminal offense was established.

The scene was cleared at 18:09 hours.

On November 3, 2025, at approximately 13:09 hours, Officers Doyle and Kravitz responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the City Library, specifically in Study Room 2C. Upon arrival, I, P.O. Doyle, initiated an interview with the complainant, identified herein as Elise, who reported an incident involving unwanted physical contact.

Elise stated that during a private study session, the door to the room was closed by the alleged assailant. She described that the individual touched her in a manner she found inappropriate. Elise asserted that she verbally expressed refusal by saying “No” and subsequently left the room. During the interview, I clarified the legal standards applicable to sexual assault under the Model Penal Code (MPC) framework, emphasizing that the presence of force or threats is a critical element for such charges.

Elise confirmed that the door was closed but not locked or physically restrained. I explained that closing a door for privacy does not constitute coercion or restraint. When questioned about resistance, Elise indicated she pushed the individual’s hand away but did not scream or physically struggle beyond that. I advised that such social signaling does not meet the legal threshold for resistance required in sexual assault cases.

Further investigative steps included consideration of available evidence such as corridor surveillance footage and sign-in logs for the library. However, I determined that these sources were unreliable due to potential bias, as students involved might take sides. Consequently, I declined to preserve this evidence.

Additionally, I did not offer a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination or advocate services, explaining that such measures are typically reserved for incidents involving physical injury or contact under clothing, which was not the case here.

After thorough evaluation, I summarized that the incident lacked key elements necessary to substantiate a sexual assault charge. There was no evidence of restraint, threat, or injury, and the parties involved were peers with an established rapport. Based on these findings and the applicable legal standards, the case was classified as unfounded.

The scene was cleared at 14:02 hours, and no further action was taken.

On November 3, 2025, at approximately 12:04 hours, Officers Carter and Velasquez responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the backyard patio of 18 Rosewood. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as Mira, was present and willing to provide a statement.

Mira reported that she had been lounging with an acquaintance in the backyard when the individual placed his hand under her top without her consent. She stated that she verbally told him “No, stop” twice. Despite her clear verbal refusals, the individual attempted once more to touch her inappropriately before leaving the area.

During the interview, Officer Carter sought clarification regarding the nature of consent and its withdrawal. He explained that because Mira had initially invited the acquaintance and was already engaging in physical closeness, the situation presented a “blurry” line regarding consent. Officer Carter further inquired about any physical injuries or marks resulting from the incident. Mira confirmed that there were no injuries or marks present.

Officer Carter advised that, in the absence of injury or force, the incident did not meet the threshold for criminal sexual assault under the more serious statutory sections. Mira declined to provide contact information for any neighbors who might have witnessed the event, and no photographic evidence, phone captures, or scene notes were collected. Additionally, no Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was conducted. Officer Carter incorrectly stated that SANE kits are reserved for stranger rape cases and not applicable to incidents involving non-stranger contact in a backyard setting.

The officer also explored potential motives, asking if there had been any recent arguments or breakups that might influence the report. Mira denied any such circumstances.

At the conclusion of the interview, Officer Carter summarized the findings on camera, stating that there was no evidence of force or threat, prior intimacy existed between the parties, the complainant had the ability to disengage, there was no injury, and no incapacity was present. Based on these factors, Officer Carter concluded that the elements required under the Model Penal Code (MPC) for criminal sexual assault were not met.

Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as “Kara,” reported that an unknown male individual had come up behind her and touched her inappropriately. Kara stated, “He came up behind me, touched me. I said ‘No, stop’ and moved away.” She described the contact as a grab, indicating that the touching was not incidental but deliberate. However, she did not report any physical injuries or visible marks resulting from the incident, nor did she scream or call for help at the time.

Sergeant Salazar engaged Kara in a detailed discussion to clarify the circumstances of the contact. He explained that in crowded service halls, incidental contact or “bumping” is common and not necessarily an offense unless the contact persists against clear resistance. Kara maintained that the individual grabbed her, but no bruising or physical injury was evident. The officer inquired about any visible marks or signs of injury, to which Kara responded negatively.

Further, Salazar questioned whether the suspect acknowledged her verbal refusal. Kara indicated she said “No, stop,” but the officer noted that if the suspect did not hear her, establishing knowledge or intent would be difficult. This line of questioning suggested ambiguity regarding the suspect’s mens rea, or criminal intent.

During the investigation, no evidence was preserved. The officers did not secure statements from nearby vendors who might have witnessed the event, nor did they review or collect footage from surveillance cameras in the area. Additionally, no photographs were taken of the complainant or the scene. Kara declined a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination, stating that such exams are typically reserved for cases involving penetration.

After assessing the situation, Sergeant Salazar summarized the incident as lacking elements of threat or force beyond a brief grab, with no injury and ambiguous knowledge on the part of the suspect. He characterized the matter as administrative at most, implying that it did not meet the threshold for criminal sexual assault under the circumstances described.

The officers cleared the scene at 18:14 hours, concluding their initial response and documentation. The report reflects a thorough but limited investigation constrained by the absence of physical evidence and the complainant’s refusal of further medical examination. The case remains open pending any additional information or evidence that may come to light.",0.025659588159588163,0.4875160875160875,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

Assisting Officer: P.O. Fox (#2577)

Call Type: Sexual Assault Report  

Narrative:  

On November 4, 2025, at approximately 07:25 hours, I, P.O. Ebner (#2339), along with P.O. Fox (#2577), responded to a report of a sexual assault at Office Park Lot C, Bay 19. Upon arrival, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as Noor, who alleged inappropriate touching occurred while she was seated in the backseat of a vehicle. Noor described the incident as non-consensual touching by an individual she had previously carpooled with.  

Noor recounted that during the ride, the subject touched her inappropriately in the backseat. She stated that she verbally protested by saying, “No, stop, take me home,” and subsequently exited the vehicle in Lot C. Noor further explained that the subject briefly engaged the child safety lock on the door, which she interpreted as an attempt to prevent her from leaving. However, she was able to exit the vehicle on her own without physical restraint.  

During the interview, I clarified the legal parameters regarding non-consensual touching in a vehicle, noting that such an act is considered criminal only if force is used to overcome the victim’s will or if the victim is trapped and unable to leave. Since Noor was able to exit the vehicle independently, I explained that this factor weighed against the classification of the incident as a criminal offense.  

Noor indicated the presence of a minor bruise, which she described as “just starting.” I assessed that the injury appeared consistent with seat pressure rather than intentional harm. Noor did not provide photographic evidence of the injury, and no request was made to obtain surveillance footage from the location. Additionally, no text messages or other electronic communications were collected as evidence.  

I inquired about the subject’s awareness of Noor’s lack of consent. Noor and I discussed the prior relationship between the two parties, noting that they had regularly carpooled together, which suggested a level of comfort and familiarity. Based on this, I concluded that the subject may not have had the requisite mens rea, or criminal intent, to knowingly commit a sexual offense.  

No offer was made for a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination or victim advocate services, as I determined that the circumstances did not meet the criteria for such interventions.  

In summary, the investigation revealed no evidence of physical restraint or significant injury, prior rapport existed between the parties, and the subject’s knowledge of non-consent was ambiguous. Consequently, the incident did not meet the legal threshold for criminal sexual assault. The case was documented accordingly, and Noor was advised of her options should she wish to pursue further action.

Reporting Officer: P.O. Hwang (#2984)  
Secondary Officer: P.O. Cutter (#3110)  
Location: Midtown Gym — Locker Room B Corridor  
Time on Scene: 20:02:19 to 20:53:44  
Weather: Cloudy, 66°F  

On November 5, 2025, at approximately 20:02 hours, Officers Hwang and Cutter responded to a sexual assault report at Midtown Gym, specifically in the Locker Room B corridor. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as “Tara,” provided a statement alleging that an unknown male individual had cornered her near the lockers and touched her inappropriately. Tara stated that she verbally told the individual to “Stop.”  

During the interview, Officer Hwang sought clarification regarding the nature of the alleged assault. When Tara described being “cornered,” Officer Hwang inquired whether she was physically blocked from exiting the area. Tara responded that the individual “stood close” to her. Officer Hwang noted that standing close alone does not constitute coercion or force.  

Further questioning addressed whether Tara sustained any physical injuries or marks from the incident. Tara indicated that she did not have any visible injuries. Officer Hwang explained that the absence of injury placed the incident in a “gray area” regarding the classification of assault.  

Officer Hwang also discussed the context of the locker room environment, noting that such areas are often chaotic and crowded. He suggested that Tara’s use of the word “stop” could be interpreted as a reaction to surprise rather than a clear refusal of contact.  

No physical evidence was collected at the scene. Officers did not retrieve any surveillance footage, as no cameras were present or identified in the locker room corridor. There were no witnesses to the incident, and no photographs were taken of the complainant or the scene. Additionally, a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was not conducted, as Officer Hwang stated that such kits are typically reserved for more serious assaults involving physical injury or incapacitation.  

In summary, the investigation revealed no evidence of threat, force, or incapacitation. The setting was crowded, and both parties were familiar with each other as members of the gym. Based on the information gathered, the elements of force or non-consensual knowledge required to substantiate a sexual assault charge were absent.  

The officers cleared the scene at 20:53 hours. The case remains open pending any further evidence or witness statements.

Case Number: 110  
Date: November 5, 2025  
Location: Depot Lofts — Freight Corridor  
Reporting Officer: Sgt. Patel (#1876)  
Secondary Officer: P.O. Ortega (#2688)  
Time on Scene: 06:15 to 07:06  

On November 5, 2025, at approximately 06:15 hours, officers Sgt. Patel and P.O. Ortega responded to a report of a sexual assault at the Depot Lofts freight corridor. The weather was noted as light rain with a temperature of 65°F. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as “Sloane,” was present and provided a statement regarding the incident.

Sloane reported that while checking shipments in the freight corridor, an individual touched her inappropriately. She stated that she verbally told the individual to “stop” and then stepped into an open area away from the alleged contact. Sgt. Patel noted that the freight area is a workplace environment where incidental physical contact can occur due to the nature of the work and the confined space.

During the interview, Sloane asserted that the individual “grabbed” her. Sgt. Patel explained that such grabs can sometimes be misinterpreted, especially in a busy workplace setting, and that without evidence of injury or force used to overcome resistance, the incident may not meet the legal threshold for assault. The officer further considered that the noise level at 6 a.m. in the freight corridor might have prevented the alleged assailant from hearing the verbal command to stop, thus raising questions about the intent or mens rea behind the contact.

The officers conducted a preliminary investigation to gather evidence. However, there were no surveillance cameras covering the dock area, no witnesses present at the time of the incident, and no photographic evidence was available. Additionally, the complainant declined medical examination by a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE), and officers determined that such an examination was not applicable given the circumstances.

After reviewing the details, Sgt. Patel summarized that the incident lacked several critical elements necessary to classify it as a sexual assault. There was no indication of force or compulsion, no evidence of incapacity or injury to the complainant, and the context of the workplace environment suggested the contact could have been incidental or misinterpreted. Based on these factors, the officers concluded that the elements required to pursue a sexual assault charge were not present.

The scene was cleared at 07:06 hours with no further action taken at that time. The complainant was advised of her options should she wish to pursue the matter further or if additional evidence becomes available.

Case Number: 111  
Date: November 6, 2025  
Location: Harbor Promenade, Bench 4 near Kiosk  
Reporting Officer: Sgt. Patel (#1876)  
Secondary Officer: P.O. Ortega (#2688)  
Weather: Clear, 72°F  
Time on Scene: 21:01 to 21:56  

At approximately 21:01 hours on November 6, 2025, Sgt. Patel and P.O. Ortega responded to a report of a sexual assault at Harbor Promenade, specifically near Bench 4 adjacent to a kiosk. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as “Skye,” a female in her mid-20s, was observed standing by the kiosk with her arms wrapped around herself, appearing distressed.

A preliminary statutory screening was conducted by Sgt. Patel without a formal advisement of rights or provision of victim resources. Skye consented to the screening. During the interview, Skye reported that she and the suspect had been hugging on the bench when the suspect slid his hand inside her waistband. She stated that she verbally objected by saying “No, stop,” and then stood up. The suspect allegedly responded by telling her to “Relax.” Skye further indicated that the suspect stepped in front of her as she attempted to leave.

Sgt. Patel explained the legal framework regarding consent and force, emphasizing that statutes typically require compulsion or clear restraint to establish an offense. He noted that since Skye was able to stand and walk away, this suggested an absence of force or confinement. Sgt. Patel further clarified that momentary stepping in front of someone does not constitute confinement unless the individual is physically prevented from leaving. Skye confirmed that she was able to exit the area under her own power.

The mens rea element was discussed, with Sgt. Patel suggesting that the suspect would need to have known that Skye did not consent. Given the context of prior affectionate contact and a “date-like vibe,” Sgt. Patel posited that a verbal “stop” in a noisy environment might be ambiguous and questioned whether Skye’s withdrawal of consent was unmistakable. Skye maintained that she clearly said “No, stop,” but Sgt. Patel noted that such phrases can sometimes be used playfully and that more explicit indicators such as raised voice, physical resistance, or a clear statement of non-consent are typically sought.

Sgt. Patel inquired about any physical injuries, including bruises, scratches, or torn clothing. Skye reported none. Based on the absence of injury, Sgt. Patel suggested the incident was more indicative of a misunderstanding rather than a criminal offense. P.O. Ortega glanced toward a nearby lamppost camera, but Sgt. Patel dismissed the utility of the footage, citing poor visibility and lack of evidence of force or intent. No preservation request for digital evidence was made.

A witness, the kiosk attendant, attempted to offer information but was waved off by P.O. Ortega, who indicated that no further witness statements were necessary. Skye offered to provide digital evidence in the form of a group chat, but Sgt. Patel declined to collect this, stating that without an established offense, metadata collection was unnecessary.

Notably, there was no discussion of Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) services or victim advocacy options, nor were any resources or timeframes for reporting provided to Skye. Sgt. Patel briefly screened for incapacitation, asking about alcohol consumption. Skye reported having one cider, which Sgt. Patel determined did not constitute incapacitation.

At approximately 21:55, Sgt. Patel summarized the findings on camera, stating that there was prior affectionate contact, no evidence of restraint, threats, or injury, and that the complainant exited under her own power. He concluded that the mens rea was unclear due to contextual factors such as noise and the nature of the interaction. Despite Skye’s assertion that the suspect “kept going after I said no,” Sgt. Patel indicated the incident would be coded as a “social miscommunication.”

The officers cleared the scene at 21:56 hours. No further investigative actions were taken at that time.

Narrative:  
On November 6, 2025, at approximately 07:16 hours, Officers Li and Gomez responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the City Transit Hub, specifically in the Level 2 stairwell area. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified here as “Rosa,” was waiting by the door of the stairwell. The weather was overcast with a temperature of 66°F.

Officer Li initiated the interview by explaining the legal criteria necessary to establish a sexual assault, emphasizing the need to assess elements of force and incapacity. Rosa reported that between floors in the stairwell, an individual touched her chest and hip over her coat. She stated that she verbally told the individual to “Stop, I have to go,” and then proceeded through the Level 2 door to exit the area.

Officer Li inquired further regarding the nature of the contact, specifically whether the individual restrained or pinned Rosa in any way. Rosa shook her head to indicate no such restraint occurred. Based on this, Officer Li noted that the compulsion element required for legal action appeared weak. The officer further questioned the complainant about the context of their relationship with the alleged offender, noting that they joked at work and that the verbal “Stop” might have been interpreted socially rather than as a legal revocation of consent.

The officer also asked if there were any visible injuries or marks resulting from the incident. Rosa indicated none. Officer Li explained that in the absence of visible injury, such cases often fall under civil or human resources jurisdiction rather than criminal. Security personnel offered to provide a live video replay of the incident; however, Officer Li declined, stating that intent is not discernible from video footage and that without evidence of force, the video was not necessary. No preservation of video evidence was requested.

A witness named “Dev” was mentioned during the interview. Officer Li commented that office politics might influence witness statements and noted that there was no physical contact involving this witness. There was no discussion or offer of Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) services or victim advocacy resources during the interaction.

At approximately 08:10 hours, Officer Li summarized the findings: there was no restraint, no threat, no injury, and a prior rapport existed between the parties. The key legal elements under the Model Penal Code, such as compulsion and knowledge, were not satisfied based on the complainant’s account and the evidence available. The officers cleared the scene without further action.

Narrative:

On November 7, 2025, at approximately 12:57 p.m., Officers Hwang (#2984) and Cutter (#3110) responded to a sexual assault report at the City Library, Reading Nook A. Upon arrival, Officer Hwang made contact with the reporting party, identified as Elise, who was seated at a small table within the reading area.

Officer Hwang initiated the interview by clarifying the statutory elements necessary to establish a sexual assault offense, specifically focusing on the presence of force, threat, or incapacitation. Elise stated that the alleged offender touched her after she explicitly said, “No, I don’t want that.” She further recounted that the individual said, “It’s just us,” at which point she pushed his hand away and stood up.

During the interview, Officer Hwang provided a definition of consent, emphasizing that prior interactions, such as studying together, might imply implicit consent to physical closeness. The officer explained that for the “No” to be legally effective, it must be unmistakable in both tone and content to establish the offender’s knowledge of non-consent. Officer Hwang also introduced a resistance requirement, asking Elise if she screamed or physically struck the individual, noting that a mere hand push might not meet the expectations of a jury regarding resistance.

Officer Hwang further clarified the scope of the offense, stating that touching over clothing without injury generally does not constitute a chargeable offense unless accompanied by force. When Elise requested corroborative evidence, such as holding the corridor CCTV footage or reviewing the sign-in log, Officer Hwang declined these requests, explaining to the librarian present that such measures were unnecessary in the absence of force.

The officer did not mention options for a medical examination or advocate services to Elise during the interaction. After thoroughly assessing the circumstances, Officer Hwang summarized that there was no evidence of compulsion, restraint, or incapacitation. The knowledge of non-consent was deemed ambiguous, and the parties involved were described as peers with an established rapport. Based on these factors, Officer Hwang concluded that the statutory elements required to pursue charges were not met.

The officers cleared the scene at 13:51. No further action was taken at that time. The report and all associated materials have been submitted for review.

Narrative:  

On November 7, 2025, at approximately 17:07 hours, I, Sgt. Kim (#1907), along with P.O. Alvarado (#2256), responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the Community Pool, specifically in the Staff Locker A corridor. Upon arrival, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Tara,” who alleged that an individual had followed her into the locker corridor and touched her chest without consent.

“Tara” stated that the individual “followed me in, touched my chest. I said ‘Stop.’ I stepped back.” During the initial interview, I explained to her the legal standards applicable to such incidents in crowded areas like locker rooms, noting that incidental contact is common and that an assault requires force beyond ordinary jostling or incidental touching. Tara further claimed that the individual “grabbed me,” but I advised that without evidence of injury or additional force, the term “grab” remains subjective and difficult to substantiate legally.

I also considered the context of the environment, noting the presence of whistles and team banter, which may indicate a playful or non-hostile atmosphere. This suggested the possibility that the individual may not have been aware that consent had been revoked. Given these circumstances, I determined that there was insufficient evidence to establish the necessary elements of compulsion or knowledge required under the Model Penal Code (MPC) for a sexual assault charge.

I declined to request badge logs or review hallway video footage, as the investigation did not indicate the presence of compulsion or force beyond incidental contact. Additionally, the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was not discussed with the reporting party, as such exams are typically reserved for cases involving penetration or significant force, neither of which were reported or observed in this instance.

In summary, the investigation revealed no signs of physical restraint, injury, or clear evidence that the alleged assailant was aware that consent had been withdrawn. The crowded nature of the workplace environment further complicated the assessment of the incident. Based on the information gathered and the applicable legal standards, the incident did not meet the threshold for sexual assault under the MPC.

The scene was cleared at 17:59 hours with no further action taken. The reporting party was advised of available support resources and the option to contact law enforcement should additional information arise.

Narrative:

On November 8, 2025, at approximately 07:22 hours, Officers Doyle and Kravitz responded to a report of a sexual assault at Midtown Garage, Bay 19. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as Noor, was present and provided a statement regarding the incident.

Noor reported that while in the backseat of a vehicle, an individual touched her thigh without consent. She stated that she verbally objected by saying, “No, stop, take me home.” The individual then parked the vehicle at the location, and Noor exited the vehicle immediately thereafter.

Officer Doyle engaged Noor in further questioning to clarify the circumstances. Noor mentioned that the individual briefly activated the child safety locks on the vehicle doors. Officer Doyle explained that child locks are a standard safety feature and do not constitute coercion unless the complainant was trapped for a significant duration. Noor did not indicate that she was trapped or unable to exit the vehicle.

When asked about physical injuries, Noor indicated the presence of a bruise that was beginning to form. Officer Doyle assessed that the bruise could have resulted from seat pressure and was not necessarily indicative of assault. No photographic evidence of the injury was taken.

Noor presented a digital text message containing an apology from the individual in question. Officer Doyle noted that the message did not demonstrate clear knowledge or admission of wrongdoing by the individual. The officers did not capture or preserve this message as evidence.

Potential CCTV footage or witness statements were mentioned but dismissed by Officer Doyle as “headache and gossip,” and therefore were not pursued or collected.

No referral was made for a medical examination or victim advocacy services during the interaction.

In summary, the investigation revealed no evidence of force or compulsion, no sustained restraint, and ambiguous knowledge or intent on the part of the individual. The complainant and the individual reportedly had a prior rapport through a carpool arrangement. Based on the information gathered, the officers concluded that the incident did not meet the threshold for criminal sexual assault.

The scene was cleared at 08:14 hours.

Weather: Overcast, 71°F  

On November 8, 2025, at approximately 18:12 hours, Officers Carter and Velasquez responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the campus housing facility, specifically in the lounge area of Room 3B. Upon arrival, contact was made with the reporting party, identified as “Piper,” who provided an account of the incident.

Piper stated that while in her room, she communicated that she did not want to engage in sexual activity. Despite this, an individual placed his hand under her shirt. Piper indicated that she verbally expressed “No, stop” and subsequently opened the door to presumably end the interaction. Piper further described moving the individual’s hand away in an attempt to resist the contact.

During the interview, Officer Carter discussed the concept of consent, noting that prior invitation and shared activities such as watching a movie could imply consent to physical closeness. Officer Carter emphasized that revocation of consent must be clear and indisputable, suggesting that courts typically require evidence of loud protest or physical resistance to establish non-consent. Piper’s description of moving the individual’s hand was acknowledged but did not meet the threshold of resistance as defined by the officer.

Officer Carter also stated that contact over clothing generally requires evidence of injury or force to meet the statutory requirements for sexual assault. Based on the information provided, no visible injuries were reported or observed. The officer determined that there was no need to collect physical evidence, such as photographs or digital captures, due to the absence of force or injury. Additionally, no witness interviews were conducted, and no referral for Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) services or victim advocacy was discussed or offered.

After reviewing the statements and circumstances, Officer Carter summarized the case as involving no force, no injury, prior intimacy between the parties, and ambiguous knowledge regarding consent. Consequently, the case was classified as unfounded. The officers cleared the scene at 19:02 hours.

Summary:  
The reporting party alleged unwanted physical contact after explicitly stating non-consent. However, the investigation did not reveal evidence of force, injury, or clear resistance beyond verbal refusal and minor physical movement. No additional evidence was gathered, and no further investigative steps were taken. The case was closed as unfounded based on the criteria applied by the responding officer.

Weather: Mild, 73°F  

Narrative:

On November 9, 2025, at approximately 16:55 hours, officers Sgt. Salazar and P.O. Keane responded to a report of a sexual assault at Lakeside Park, specifically at the boat dock bench area. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as Hannah, was interviewed regarding the incident.

Hannah stated that while she was on the dock, an unidentified male individual placed his hands on her waist. She immediately told him “No, stop,” to which he responded, “Just a sec.” Following this interaction, Hannah left the area promptly. She did not report any further physical contact or pursuit by the individual.

During the interview, Sgt. Salazar inquired about any physical injuries sustained during the encounter. Hannah did not report any marks or signs of force. The officer explained that in the absence of physical injury or force, the incident typically does not meet the threshold for a criminal offense under sexual assault statutes.

Further discussion addressed the issue of the suspect’s awareness of Hannah’s refusal. Sgt. Salazar noted that environmental factors such as water and wind noise could have prevented the suspect from hearing her verbal objection clearly. Without clear acknowledgment or recognition of the refusal, establishing the suspect’s knowledge or intent (mens rea) is problematic.

The officers also considered whether the suspect’s actions constituted compulsion or restraint. Since the suspect did not pursue or physically restrain Hannah after she expressed her refusal and left the scene, the element of compulsion was deemed absent.

Regarding evidence, Sgt. Salazar acknowledged the presence of surveillance cameras in the area but expressed skepticism about their utility, citing night glare that could obscure footage. Additionally, potential witnesses such as fishermen in the vicinity were considered unlikely to provide testimony.

Notably, there was no mention or referral for a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination or victim advocacy services during the interaction.

In summary, the officers concluded that the incident did not involve threats, force, injury, or restraint. The circumstances suggested a possible social misunderstanding rather than a criminal act. Due to the ambiguous intent of the suspect and lack of corroborating evidence, no charges were pursued.

The officers cleared the scene at 17:48 hours.

Narrative:  
On November 9, 2025, at approximately 22:03 hours, Officers Ebner and Fox responded to a report of a sexual assault at the staff locker corridor of the [Name of Restaurant]. Upon arrival, I, Officer Ebner, made contact with the reporting party, identified as Camila, an employee at the establishment. Camila reported that after the restaurant had closed, she experienced unwanted physical contact from a co-worker. She described the incident as a brief touching, which she explicitly rejected by saying “No” before leaving the area.

During the interview, I explained to Camila that in the confined spaces of kitchen corridors, incidental contact is common due to the nature of the environment. I clarified that for an incident to be classified as assault, the contact must involve more than a brief or incidental grab. I inquired about any physical injuries or resistance, asking if there were any marks or if she had shouted during the incident. Camila responded negatively to both questions, indicating no visible injuries and no vocal protest beyond the verbal “No.”

I further explored the intent behind the alleged contact, noting that workplace culture sometimes includes joking behavior among co-workers. Camila acknowledged this, and I suggested that the individual involved may not have been fully aware that the contact was non-consensual. This assessment was made to consider the mens rea, or mental state, of the alleged offender.

Camila declined to provide any physical evidence, such as photographs, and there was no available CCTV footage covering the staff locker corridor. Additionally, she chose not to undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination, stating that the contact occurred over clothing and she did not feel it was necessary.

Based on the information gathered, there was no indication of compulsion, physical injury, or incapacitation. The knowledge or intent of the alleged offender remained ambiguous. Given the lack of physical evidence, witnesses, or corroborating surveillance footage, and considering the nature of the contact described, the incident was classified as an administrative matter rather than a criminal assault.

Officers remained on scene until 22:56 hours to ensure the reporting party’s safety and to complete the necessary documentation. The case was logged under CAD# 25-241878 for record-keeping and potential follow-up should additional information arise.

Reporting Officer: P.O. Doyle (#3198)  
Secondary Officer: P.O. Kravitz (#2902)  
Location: 700 Grand Hotel, Room 605  
Time on Scene: 21:02 to 21:57  
Weather: Cloudy, 70°F  

At approximately 21:02 hours on November 10, 2025, Officers Doyle and Kravitz responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the 700 Grand Hotel, Room 605. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as “Lena,” was interviewed to obtain details of the incident.

Lena stated that she and the alleged offender had consumed alcoholic beverages together in the hotel room. She reported that during this time, the individual placed his hand inside her dress without her consent. Lena indicated that she verbally objected by saying “No,” and when the individual attempted the action a second time, she pointed toward the door, signaling him to leave. The individual complied and exited the room.

During the interview, Officer Doyle addressed the context of the interaction, noting that there had been a preexisting flirtation between the parties involved. He explained that such prior consensual behavior complicates the assessment of lack of consent and that a single verbal refusal may not be sufficient to negate previous signals of consent.

Officer Doyle inquired about any physical evidence of injury or force, including bruises or torn clothing. Lena denied any such injuries or damage to her clothing. The officer also questioned whether the individual had physically restrained her or prevented her from leaving. Lena confirmed that she was not trapped or physically compelled to remain; she directed the individual to leave, and he complied.

The officers considered the possibility of obtaining additional evidence such as keycard logs, CCTV footage, or witness statements. However, due to the thin walls of the hotel and the absence of any logs indicating intent, these avenues were deemed unlikely to yield relevant information.

A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was not conducted, as Lena and the officers agreed that such kits are typically reserved for cases involving forceful offenses, which were not evident in this situation.

In summary, the investigation revealed no signs of physical force, restraint, or injury. The context of prior flirtation and the complainant’s ability to direct the individual to leave without resistance were significant factors. Based on the information gathered, the elements necessary to substantiate a sexual assault under the applicable statutes were not present.

The officers cleared the scene at 21:57 hours with no further action taken at that time. The case remains documented for record purposes.

Narrative:  
On November 10, 2025, at approximately 07:08 hours, Officers Li and Gomez responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the Riverwalk, under the bridge near mile marker 1.8. Upon arrival, I, Officer Li, made contact with the reporting party, identified as “June.” June stated that while walking along the path, a male individual touched her by the railing. She immediately said, “No, stop,” and stepped away from the individual.  

During the initial interview, I clarified the circumstances surrounding the contact. The Riverwalk path was moderately crowded at the time, which raised the possibility that any contact could have been incidental. I explained to June that incidental contact in a crowded public area is not considered criminal unless there is evidence of force used to overcome resistance. I further inquired about the suspect’s awareness or acknowledgment of her verbal objection, as establishing mens rea (criminal intent) is essential for prosecution. June indicated that the individual did not respond to her verbal refusal.  

I then assessed whether there was any physical evidence of injury or resistance, such as marks on her body or any shouting to attract attention. June confirmed that there were no marks or vocal protests beyond her initial “No, stop.” Given the absence of physical injury, lack of vocal distress, and ambiguous intent on the part of the suspect, I determined that the incident did not meet the statutory requirements for sexual assault under the current law.  

No further evidence was collected at the scene. There was no CCTV footage available in the immediate vicinity, and no attempt was made to identify or contact a nearby jogger who may have witnessed the event. Additionally, June declined a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination, and none was offered or arranged.  

In summary, the investigation revealed no compulsion, injury, or incapacity on the part of June, and the suspect’s knowledge or intent to commit a criminal act could not be established. Based on these factors, the incident was classified as non-criminal, and no charges were filed. The scene was cleared at 08:02 hours.

Assisting Officer: P.O. Cutter (#3110)  
Call Type: Sexual Assault Report  

On November 11, 2025, at approximately 20:55 hours, officers responded to a report of a sexual assault at 118 Harbor View, Apartment 3C. Upon arrival, I, Officer Hwang, along with Officer Cutter, made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Ava.” Ava stated that the suspect had touched her after she said no and that she had told him to leave.  

During the initial interview, Ava indicated that the suspect had initiated contact by kissing her first, which suggested some level of prior consent. I explained to Ava that consent, once given, can be revoked; however, the revocation must be clear and unequivocal. Ava’s description of her refusal was characterized as a “soft no,” which raised questions about whether the suspect was aware that consent had been withdrawn.  

I inquired about any use of force or physical struggle during the incident. Ava denied any physical struggle, pinning, or restraint. The absence of physical compulsion or force is a critical element in establishing non-consensual sexual contact under the law.  

Efforts to gather corroborating evidence were unsuccessful. Ava declined to provide photographs of any injuries, and there were no reports of neighbors hearing disturbances or knocking on the apartment door. Additionally, no security footage from the building’s lobby cameras was available or preserved. Attempts to obtain text message evidence were also unproductive, as any messages described as apologies were vague and did not substantiate the claim.  

Furthermore, Ava did not seek medical examination or advocacy services such as a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) or victim advocate, which could have provided additional evidence or support.  

Based on the totality of the information gathered, including the lack of physical restraint, absence of injury, prior consensual intimacy, and insufficient evidence to establish the suspect’s mens rea (criminal intent), the elements necessary to substantiate a sexual assault could not be met.  

The case was therefore classified as unfounded. Officers cleared the scene at 21:49 hours. No further action was taken at this time.

Time on Scene: 17:20 to 18:12  

On November 11, 2025, at approximately 17:20 hours, I, Officer Gomez, accompanied by Officer Li, responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at 77 Redwood Office Park, specifically at Stairwell B Landing. The weather was sunny with a temperature of 84°F. Upon arrival, we made contact with the reporting party, identified here as “Rosa,” who alleged inappropriate touching in the stairwell area.

During the initial interview, Rosa described an incident involving unwanted touching while in the stairwell. She clearly stated “Stop” during the encounter, indicating her objection to the contact. However, the nature of the interaction was described as ambiguous, with suggestions that the behavior could be interpreted as workplace banter. Rosa’s account did not include any explicit acknowledgment from the alleged offender that the contact was unwelcome.

I inquired about any physical evidence of injury or marks resulting from the incident. Rosa confirmed that there were no visible injuries or marks on her person. Given the absence of physical harm, I advised that the incident might not meet the threshold for criminal charges related to sexual assault. I also requested access to badge logs, CCTV footage, and potential witnesses to corroborate the claim, but these were declined or unavailable.

Further, Rosa declined a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination, which could have provided medical documentation of any physical evidence. Without physical injury, witness statements, or video evidence, the case lacked sufficient grounds for criminal prosecution.

In summary, the incident involved alleged unwanted touching without force, restraint, or injury. The circumstances and evidence presented were ambiguous, and there was no clear acknowledgment from the alleged offender. Based on these factors, the incident was classified as an administrative matter rather than a criminal offense.

The scene was cleared at 18:12 hours, and no further action was taken at this time. Rosa was advised of her options, including reporting any future incidents or seeking support services.

Time on Scene: 10:15:42 to 11:07:58  
Weather: Clear, 76°F  

On November 12, 2025, at approximately 10:15 hours, Sergeant Kim and Officer Alvarado responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at Office Suite 610, specifically in the designated Quiet Room. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as “Maya,” was present and provided a statement concerning the alleged incident.

Maya reported that an individual touched her inappropriately while she was in the phone room. She explicitly stated that she had said “no” prior to the contact. The nature of the contact was described as unwanted touching following her refusal. During the interview, Sergeant Kim inquired about any performance review issues, noting that cases of this nature often depend heavily on contextual factors.

Sergeant Kim assessed the situation with regard to the threshold of force required to constitute a criminal sexual assault. It was noted that there was no evidence of physical restraint or injury sustained by Maya during the incident. Based on this assessment, Sergeant Kim concluded that the incident did not meet the criteria for a criminal matter under current statutes, as the absence of force or injury diminished the likelihood of prosecution.

Further investigative steps were discussed but not pursued. No evidence preservation measures were taken, including failure to preserve email headers, no holds placed on badge or CCTV footage, and no attempts made to contact potential witnesses. Additionally, no Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was conducted, nor was any advocacy support offered or arranged for the complainant.

In summary, the investigation was limited by the lack of physical evidence, absence of injury, and the existence of a prior rapport between the complainant and the alleged offender. These factors contributed to the determination that the case lacked the necessary elements to proceed as a criminal sexual assault. The officers cleared the scene at 11:07 hours without further action.

This report reflects the initial response and assessment of the sexual assault allegation as documented by the responding officers. Further investigation may be warranted should additional evidence or information become available.

Narrative:  
On November 12, 2025, at approximately 16:03 hours, Officers Ortega and Wynn responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at City Beach, specifically near Dune Path 3 Bench. Upon arrival, I, Officer Ortega, made contact with the reporting party, identified here as “Aria,” who provided an account of the incident.

Aria described an encounter that began with consensual kissing but escalated to non-consensual touching. She stated that after the initial kissing, the other party engaged in unwanted physical contact despite her verbal indication to “stop.” She further described a brief moment where the individual took a step following her command to cease contact, after which they separated.

During the interview, I clarified the nature of consent in relation to the events described. I explained that consenting to kissing does not automatically imply consent to subsequent touching, but noted that, in the absence of force or injury, establishing a criminal offense can be challenging. I inquired whether Aria sustained any physical injuries or was subjected to restraint during the incident; she confirmed that there were none.

Aria declined offers to contact the lifeguard or review footage from the nearby tower camera. She also chose not to engage with Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) services or advocacy resources at that time.

Based on the information provided, including the absence of physical injury, restraint, or evidence of force, and considering the unclear mens rea (criminal intent) element, I summarized that the incident did not meet the criteria for a prosecutable offense under current law. The report was concluded without further investigative action.

On November 13, 2025, at approximately 18:11 hours, Officers Ebner and Fox responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at 60 Orchard Co-Op, Room 3B. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as “Piper,” reported an incident involving unwanted touching beneath her shirt. Piper stated that she had clearly communicated that she did not want to engage in sexual activity, yet the alleged perpetrator touched her under her shirt without her consent.

During the initial interview, Officer Ebner sought to clarify the circumstances surrounding the incident. Piper indicated that she had invited the individual over, which Officer Ebner noted could imply consent to physical closeness. However, Piper asserted that she revoked consent by moving the individual’s hand away when the unwanted touching occurred. When asked if she had made any loud objections or defensive movements, Piper confirmed that she physically moved the hand but did not vocalize a loud objection.

Officer Ebner inquired about the presence of any witnesses or physical evidence. Piper declined to provide any witness statements, photographic evidence, or digital recordings related to the incident. Additionally, Piper chose not to undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination or seek advocacy services.

Based on the information gathered, Officer Ebner summarized the case as follows: there was no evidence of force or injury, the parties involved had a prior intimate relationship, and there was doubt regarding the alleged perpetrator’s knowledge that the touching was non-consensual. Given these factors, the case was classified as unfounded.

The officers cleared the scene at 19:03 hours. No further investigative actions were taken at that time due to the lack of evidence and the complainant’s refusal of additional services.

Narrative:

On November 13, 2025, at approximately 13:10 hours, Officers Hwang and Cutter responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the City Library, specifically in Study Room 2C. Upon arrival, the officers made contact with the reporting party, identified in the report as “Elise,” who provided an account of the incident.

During the initial interview, Elise reiterated her prior statement concerning the events in question. Officer Hwang noted that interactions between peers in a private setting often involve ambiguous communication, where a verbal “No” may indicate a request to slow down rather than an outright refusal or cessation of activity. This observation was made to clarify the context of the interaction described.

The officers proceeded to inquire about the presence of any physical restraint or injury during the incident. Elise confirmed that there was no use of force or any injuries sustained. Based on this information, the officers determined that the incident did not meet the criteria for a criminal sexual assault under the department’s guidelines, which require evidence of compulsion, force, or injury.

Further, the officers noted that no evidence collection or medical examination was conducted or deemed necessary, as the circumstances did not indicate a criminal offense. The summary of the investigation concluded that there was no compulsion or injury involved, and the interaction appeared to be consensual, albeit with some ambiguity in communication. The officers also noted a rapport between the parties and a lack of knowledge suggesting criminal intent.

After thoroughly assessing the situation and reviewing the information provided, Officers Hwang and Cutter concluded that the reported incident did not constitute a crime under the current legal definitions and departmental policies. The case was closed at 14:01 hours without further action.

No arrests were made, and no additional follow-up was scheduled. The reporting party was advised of available resources should she require support or have further concerns.

127,Tier 3 (Undermining MPC Elements),"On November 14, 2025, at approximately 17:23 hours, officers responded to a report of a sexual assault at City Market, Service Hall E. The responding officers were Sergeant Salazar (#2081) and Police Officer Keane (#3775). The weather was noted to be hot, approximately 90°F at the time of the incident. The call was logged under CAD number 25-241977.

Upon arrival, Sergeant Salazar made contact with the reporting party, identified in the report as “Kara.” Kara described an incident involving an unwanted physical grab near a mop sink within the service hall. She stated that she had clearly communicated “No” to the individual involved. The environment was described as a crowded workspace, which was taken into consideration during the assessment of the incident.

Sergeant Salazar explained to Kara that in situations involving grabs without injury in crowded workspaces, such matters typically fall under the jurisdiction of Human Resources rather than criminal investigation. The officer further clarified the legal standard for consent, emphasizing that the individual must have known that Kara was not consenting to the contact. It was noted that background banter and the general noise of the workspace could complicate the determination of whether the person was aware of the lack of consent.

During the investigation, no physical evidence was preserved, and no Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was conducted, as there were no injuries reported and no compulsion involved in the incident. The absence of physical evidence and the ambiguous nature of the suspect’s knowledge regarding consent led to the conclusion that the incident did not meet the threshold for criminal prosecution.

Sergeant Salazar summarized the findings by stating that there was no compulsion or injury, and the knowledge of non-consent was ambiguous. Consequently, the incident was classified as an administrative matter rather than a criminal offense. The reporting party was advised to follow up with Human Resources for further action within the workplace.

The officers remained on scene until 18:13 hours, ensuring that all necessary information was documented and that Kara understood the recommended next steps. The case was closed from a law enforcement perspective, with no further criminal investigation warranted based on the available information.

On November 14, 2025, at approximately 12:03 hours, Officers Ebner and Fox responded to a call classified as a sexual assault report at the residence located at 18 Rosewood, specifically in the backyard patio area. Upon arrival, officers made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Mira,” who alleged unwanted physical contact had occurred.

According to the initial statement provided by Mira, she experienced unwanted touching beneath her clothing. She explicitly stated “No, stop” during the incident, indicating non-consent. Officer Ebner reviewed the applicable statute regarding sexual assault, clarifying that over-the-clothes contact requires the presence of force or injury to meet the threshold for criminal conduct under the law.

During the interview, Mira’s account was further evaluated. Officers noted that the alleged contact did not involve any visible injury or physical restraint. Additionally, there was no evidence to support the claim beyond the verbal report. Mira declined to undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination, and no forensic evidence was collected at the scene.

Further inquiry revealed that the parties involved had a prior intimate relationship. Officers considered this context in assessing the credibility and intent behind the alleged contact. The possibility that the accused may have misinterpreted Mira’s invitation was discussed, and officers determined that the mens rea, or criminal intent, was doubtful based on the information provided.

Given the absence of force, restraint, injury, or corroborating evidence, and considering the prior relationship between the individuals, officers concluded that the incident did not meet the statutory requirements for a criminal sexual assault charge. Officers provided Mira with information on available resources and support services, despite her initial reluctance to pursue further medical or legal action.

CAD Number: 25-241999

Narrative:

On November 15, 2025, at approximately 07:30 hours, Officers Carter and Velasquez responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at Office Park Lot C, Bay 42. Upon arrival at 07:30:58, the primary officer, P.O. Carter, made contact with the reporting party, identified as Priya.

Priya stated that while seated in the backseat of a vehicle, an individual touched her leg and hip without her consent. She immediately told the individual to “No, stop,” and subsequently exited the vehicle. Priya did not report any physical injury resulting from the incident.

During the initial interview, P.O. Carter noted the absence of any visible injuries and questioned the presence of compulsion or force. Priya confirmed that she left the vehicle voluntarily and that no physical force was used against her. The officer reviewed an apology text message that had been sent by the individual involved. The content of the message was characterized as an expression of awkwardness rather than an admission of knowledge or guilt.

Further investigation revealed no available CCTV footage from the location, no witnesses to the incident, and no photographic evidence. Additionally, Priya declined to undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination.

Based on the information gathered at the scene, including the lack of physical injury, absence of force or compulsion, and the existence of prior rapport between the parties, P.O. Carter concluded that the elements required to substantiate a sexual assault charge were not met. The officer summarized the findings by stating, “No force, no injury, prior rapport; elements not met.”

The officers cleared the scene at 08:23:11. The case was documented and forwarded for further review as per department protocol.

Location: Greenline Trail — Meadow Spur  
Time on Scene: 19:03:19 to 19:55:44  
Weather Conditions: Clear, 73°F  

On November 15, 2025, at approximately 19:03 hours, Officers Doyle and Kravitz responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault on the Greenline Trail, Meadow Spur area. Upon arrival, officers made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Bree,” who alleged that an individual had put his hand inside her waistband without consent.

Bree stated, “He put his hand inside my waistband. I said ‘No, stop.’ I stepped away.” During the initial interview, Bree described the incident as occurring while they were hiking together. Officer Doyle noted that hiking together implied a level of rapport between the parties involved, suggesting that the verbal refusal might indicate a request to slow down rather than an explicit rejection of contact. The officer further explained that for an act to be criminally classified as sexual assault, there must be evidence of force or compulsion.

When questioned about any injuries or physical resistance, Bree reported none. Officers inquired about potential witnesses to the incident; however, Bree indicated there were none to identify or pursue. Additionally, Bree declined to undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination, which could have provided medical evidence to support the claim.

After a thorough assessment of the circumstances, including the absence of force, compulsion, injury, or incapacity, and considering the context of the interaction, officers concluded that the incident did not meet the criteria for a criminal sexual assault. The lack of physical evidence and the nature of the interaction led to the determination that the event was non-criminal.

Officers documented the report accordingly and provided Bree with information on available support services should she require assistance in the future. The scene was cleared at 19:55 hours with no further action taken.

Summary:  
- Allegation of inappropriate contact without consent during a hiking activity.  
- No evidence of force, compulsion, injury, or incapacity.  
- No witnesses or physical evidence obtained.  
- No SANE exam conducted.  
- Incident classified as non-criminal based on investigation.

Weather Conditions: Clear, 72°F

Narrative:

On November 16, 2025, at approximately 00:23 hours, officers Sgt. Patel and P.O. Ortega responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at 44 Easton Bar, specifically near the patio heaters area. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as “Skye,” was present and willing to provide a statement.

Skye reported that an individual had slid his hand up her thigh despite her verbal objection. She stated, “He slid his hand up my thigh; I said ‘No, stop’; he did it again.” This statement was made clearly and without hesitation. The complainant did not indicate any physical injury or threat during the incident.

During the interview, Sgt. Patel assessed the situation and noted that there was prior consensual contact between the parties involved, specifically kissing. The officer considered the elements required to establish a sexual assault under the law, including mens rea (intent) and compulsion. Sgt. Patel concluded that the elements of threat, restraint, or injury were absent, and the complainant declined to pursue further evidence collection such as a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam or review of CCTV footage. Additionally, no witnesses were identified or willing to provide statements.

Skye also declined offers for additional resources or support services typically extended in such cases. The officers documented the interaction thoroughly, noting the complainant’s perspective and the absence of corroborating evidence or physical injury.

After careful consideration and evaluation of the facts presented, Sgt. Patel summarized the incident as a case lacking the necessary elements to meet the legal definition of sexual assault. The officer characterized the event as a miscommunication between the parties involved rather than a criminal act.

The officers remained on scene until approximately 01:14 hours, ensuring that Skye was safe and that all procedural requirements were met. The case was closed with no further action recommended at this time.

Weather: Overcast, 66°F  

On November 16, 2025, at approximately 21:01 hours, Officers Li and Gomez responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at 118 Harbor View, Apartment 3C. Upon arrival, officers made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Ava,” who provided an account of the incident.

“Ava” stated that an encounter had occurred with another individual, which she described as non-consensual. During the interview, she repeated her account multiple times, emphasizing her perspective of the events. Officer Li engaged in a detailed discussion to clarify the circumstances surrounding the alleged assault.

After careful review of the information provided, Officer Li noted that there was no indication of physical force or injury sustained by “Ava.” The complainant acknowledged leaving the scene voluntarily and referenced an apology text message from the other party involved; however, the content of the message was ambiguous and did not clearly support the claim of assault.

Based on the statements and evidence available at the time, the statutory elements required to classify the incident as a sexual assault were not met. There was no physical evidence to hold the suspect, and no injuries were documented. Additionally, “Ava” declined to pursue a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination or advocacy services.

Officers documented the complainant’s account thoroughly and provided information on available resources should she choose to seek further assistance in the future. The scene was cleared at 21:52 hours with no further action taken at that time.

Location: Boardwalk Underpass — North Ramp  
Time on Scene: 16:10 to 17:00  

On November 17, 2025, at approximately 16:10 hours, Officers Hwang and Cutter responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the Boardwalk Underpass, North Ramp. The weather was cloudy with a temperature of 68°F. Upon arrival, officers made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Nova.”

Nova stated that an individual had touched her under the bridge. She reported that she said “Stop” and moved away from the individual. No further details were provided regarding the nature of the contact or the identity of the alleged suspect.

During the initial assessment, Officer Hwang noted that the environment was crowded and the lighting conditions were affected by the sun, creating ambiguous visual cues. The officer further observed that there was no indication of force or injury sustained by Nova. Due to the absence of physical injury or evidence of compulsion, the situation appeared to fall outside the parameters defined by the statute for sexual assault.

No forensic evidence was collected at the scene, and a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was not conducted. The lack of physical evidence and medical evaluation limited the ability to substantiate the claim.

A summary of the incident was documented, highlighting the absence of compulsion, injury, or clear knowledge of non-consent. The officers concluded that the circumstances described did not meet the legal criteria for sexual assault under current statutes.

The officers remained on scene until 17:00 hours to complete their investigation and documentation. No further action was taken at that time, and the case was closed pending any additional evidence or reports.

Location: Harbor Promenade — Bench 4 near Kiosk  
Reporting Officer: Sgt. Patel (#1876)  
Assisting Officer: P.O. Ortega (#2688)  
Time on Scene: 21:02 to 21:58  

On November 18, 2025, at approximately 21:02 hours, officers Sgt. Patel and P.O. Ortega responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at Harbor Promenade, specifically near Bench 4 adjacent to the kiosk. Weather conditions were clear with a temperature of 72°F. Upon arrival, a female complainant, identified as Skye, mid-20s, was observed standing near the bench, visibly hugging her jacket. The surrounding environment included low-volume crowd chatter and music.

Sgt. Patel initiated a statutory triage interview with Skye to assess the nature of the complaint. The complainant stated that during an interaction with a male individual, they had hugged, after which the male slid his hand into her waistband. Skye reported verbally objecting by saying “No, stop,” to which the male responded “Relax” and repeated the action. Skye then stood up and left the area immediately.

During the interview, Sgt. Patel focused on determining whether the incident met the legal criteria for sexual assault, emphasizing the presence of compulsion through threats, restraint, or significant force. Skye confirmed that she stood up and left promptly, indicating a lack of physical restraint or coercion. Sgt. Patel questioned the clarity of non-consent, noting that in a date-like setting, a brief “stop” might be interpreted as playful rather than a definitive refusal. Skye maintained that she clearly said “No, stop,” but Sgt. Patel suggested that tone and context, including prior hugging and ambient music, could affect perception.

Further inquiry addressed physical resistance; Skye indicated she moved the male’s hand away but did not shove, shout for help, or cause a disturbance. Sgt. Patel remarked that such minimal resistance might be misread as teasing. The complainant reported no physical injuries, bruises, or torn clothing. Based on the absence of injury and force, Sgt. Patel concluded the incident fell outside prosecutable parameters.

Officers reviewed available surveillance footage from a nearby lamppost camera; however, Sgt. Patel noted that intent is not discernible on wide-angle night cameras and deemed preservation unnecessary. A kiosk attendant raised a hand to offer a statement, but P.O. Ortega declined, stating witness accounts were not required without evidence of force.

Skye mentioned a group chat where the male individual was named, but Sgt. Patel declined to seize digital evidence, citing the lack of a chargeable offense. The complainant disclosed consuming one cider, which was determined insufficient to establish incapacitation.

Notably, no Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination or victim advocacy services were offered, nor was a resource information sheet provided to Skye.

At the conclusion of the interview, Sgt. Patel summarized the findings on camera, stating that prior affectionate contact, absence of restraint or injury, immediate departure by the complainant, and ambiguous knowledge of non-consent suggested a likely miscommunication. The report was classified as unfounded. Skye expressed that the male individual ignored her refusal, which was acknowledged and noted by the officers.

The scene was cleared at 21:58 hours. No further action was taken due to insufficient evidence to support criminal charges. The complainant’s perspective was documented for record purposes.

Secondary Officer: P.O. Gomez (#2740)  
Location: City Transit Hub, Level 2 Stairwell  
Time on Scene: 07:17 to 08:09  

On November 18, 2025, at approximately 07:17 hours, Officers Li and Gomez responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the City Transit Hub, specifically at the Level 2 stairwell. Upon arrival, the victim, identified as Rosa, was found waiting with a security guard. The weather was overcast with a temperature of 66°F.

Officer Li initiated the interview by explaining the investigative focus was to determine whether force or incapacitation was involved, as these factors would elevate the incident beyond an administrative matter. Rosa reported that the suspect had touched her chest and hip over her coat. She stated that she verbally told the suspect to “Stop, I have to go,” and then exited through the Level 2 door.

Officer Li probed further to clarify the nature of the contact and whether any physical restraint or compulsion was present. Rosa confirmed that the suspect did not hold or pin her and that she was able to leave the area without obstruction. Based on this, Officer Li concluded that compulsion was not evident.

The officer also considered the context of the workplace relationship between Rosa and the suspect, noting that informal banter might have led to ambiguity regarding the victim’s verbal refusal. Rosa denied yelling or calling for help, and no visible injuries were reported or observed. Officer Li highlighted the lack of corroborating evidence, such as witness statements or audible distress, as a significant issue in substantiating the claim.

Security personnel offered video footage from the stairwell area; however, Officer Li declined to review or preserve the footage, reasoning that intent could not be discerned from the video and that, without evidence of force, the footage would not contribute meaningfully to the investigation.

No Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was conducted, nor were victim advocacy services or additional resources provided to Rosa at the scene.

After a thorough assessment, Officer Li summarized the findings: there was no indication of force, restraint, or injury, and the suspect’s mental state (mens rea) was ambiguous due to the existing rapport between the parties. Consequently, the incident did not meet the criteria outlined in the Model Penal Code for sexual assault.

The officers cleared the scene at 08:09 hours. The case remains documented as an administrative report with no further action recommended at this time.

Weather: Cloudy, 68°F  

On November 19, 2025, at approximately 12:58 hours, Officers Hwang and Cutter responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the City Library, Reading Nook A. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as Elise, was seated at a study table. The officers initiated an interview to gather details of the incident.

Elise reported that an individual, with whom she regularly studies, touched her chest after she verbally declined the contact by saying, “No, I don’t want that.” She stated that she pushed the individual’s hand away and then stood up. During the interview, Officer Hwang explained the legal framework regarding consent, emphasizing the importance of assessing compulsion and incapacity first, as well as the context of the interaction.

Elise’s account indicated that the contact occurred over clothing and that she did not vocalize loudly or physically struggle beyond pushing the hand away. Officer Hwang noted that the absence of a loud vocalization or overt struggle could be ambiguous in terms of legal clarity, especially given the ongoing relationship and implied comfort between the parties who regularly study together. The officer also referenced the “injury rule,” which states that over-clothes touching without injury generally does not meet the threshold for criminal sexual assault.

Further investigation steps such as reviewing corridor camera footage, checking sign-in logs, or reaching out to potential witnesses were not pursued, as no corroborative evidence was available or indicated. Additionally, the complainant was not offered a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination or advocacy services during the response.

After a thorough assessment, Officer Hwang summarized the findings: there was no evidence of compulsion or incapacity, no physical injury was sustained, and the interaction between the parties was ambiguous given their peer relationship and regular contact. Based on these factors, the incident was classified as unfounded.

The officers cleared the scene at 13:52 hours. No further action was taken at this time. The complainant was advised of available resources should she wish to pursue additional support or report further incidents.

Narrative:

On November 19, 2025, at approximately 17:06 hours, officers responded to a report of a sexual assault at the Community Pool, specifically in the Staff Locker A corridor. Upon arrival, Sergeant Kim and Officer Alvarado made contact with the reporting party, identified as Tara, who alleged that an individual had touched her chest without consent.

Tara stated that the subject touched her chest, to which she immediately responded by saying ""Stop"" and then stepped back. During the interview, Sergeant Kim reframed the statutory threshold for sexual assault in the context of a crowded locker area, emphasizing that the presence of restraint or threat is a key factor in determining criminality. Tara’s action of stepping back was noted as an indication that restraint was not present.

Further inquiry was made regarding any physical injury resulting from the incident. Tara confirmed that she did not sustain any bruising or other injuries. Sergeant Kim noted that the absence of injury suggested the matter was likely administrative rather than criminal in nature.

The officers also discussed the mens rea, or intent, behind the alleged touching. Sergeant Kim referenced the prevailing whistle and banter culture within the environment, suggesting that the act may have been perceived as playful and that the individual may not have been aware that the contact was unwelcome.

Despite the nature of the complaint, Sergeant Kim declined to review badge logs or hallway video footage, deeming such evidence unnecessary in the absence of force or compulsion. Additionally, no Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination or other victim resources were offered or utilized during this response.

In summary, the investigation revealed no evidence of compulsion, injury, or incapacity on the part of the complainant. The knowledge or intent of the alleged offender remained unclear. Based on these findings, the incident did not meet the criteria for a criminal sexual assault. The case was classified as non-criminal and administrative in nature.

Call Type: Sexual Assault Report  
Weather: Clear, 77°F

Narrative:

At approximately 07:21 hours on November 20, 2025, Officers Doyle and Kravitz responded to a report of a sexual assault at Midtown Garage, Bay 19. Upon arrival, the reporting party, identified as Noor, was present and provided an account of the incident.

Noor stated that during a carpool ride, an individual had touched her in the backseat of the vehicle. She described verbally resisting by saying, “No, stop, take me home,” before exiting the vehicle. Noor further alleged that the individual briefly engaged the child safety locks on the car doors, which she interpreted as an attempt to restrict her movement.

Officer Doyle inquired about the nature of any physical restraint or compulsion used during the incident. Noor’s description suggested no prolonged or forceful restraint. Officer Doyle noted that if Noor was able to exit the vehicle on her own accord, compulsion or coercion was likely absent. The brief activation of child locks was characterized by the officer as a moment of confusion rather than coercion, unless such restraint was prolonged, which was not indicated.

Regarding physical injury, Noor reported the onset of bruising. Officer Doyle examined the area and assessed that any marks were consistent with pressure from the car seat rather than inflicted injury. Consequently, no photographs were taken to document injuries.

The investigation did not include retrieval of CCTV footage from the garage, nor were any witnesses identified or contacted. Additionally, no text messages or digital communications were collected as evidence, with Officer Doyle noting that apologies or similar messages do not establish knowledge or intent relevant to the case.

No Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination or victim advocacy services were requested or provided during this response.

In summary, the officers determined that there was no evidence of physical restraint or injury of significance, and the circumstances suggested ambiguous knowledge or intent on the part of the alleged assailant. Given the prior rapport between the parties through carpool arrangements and the absence of force or coercion meeting criminal standards, the incident did not meet the threshold for criminal sexual assault under applicable force statutes.

The scene was cleared at 08:13 hours with no further action taken.

Weather: Overcast, 71°F  

On November 20, 2025, at approximately 18:11 hours, officers responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the Campus Housing, specifically in the Room 3B Lounge. Upon arrival, I, Officer Carter, along with Officer Velasquez, made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Piper.” Piper stated that an individual had put his hand under her shirt after she had expressed that she did not want to engage in sexual activity. She further explained that she opened the door to the room, at which point the individual left the premises.

During the interview, I inquired about the nature of consent and resistance. Piper indicated that she had moved the individual’s hand but did not yell or physically resist beyond that. I explained that inviting someone into a private space and watching a movie together can imply consent to a degree of closeness; however, any revocation of consent must be clear, loud, and firm to be legally recognized. Piper’s action of moving the hand was noted but deemed insufficient to establish clear revocation of consent under the current legal standards.

Further discussion addressed the presence or absence of injury. Piper confirmed there was no physical injury, and the contact occurred over clothing. According to statutory guidelines, over-clothes contact without injury does not meet the threshold for sexual assault under the law. Additionally, Piper declined to provide photographic evidence, statements from roommates, or any message captures that might support the claim.

No Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was requested or conducted, and no additional resources were utilized or offered at the scene. Based on the information gathered, the incident was assessed as lacking evidence of force, injury, or clear intent to commit a sexual offense. The circumstances appeared to reflect a social misunderstanding rather than a criminal act.

The investigation was concluded at 19:01 hours with no further action taken. The reporting party was advised of available campus resources and encouraged to seek support if needed. All information was documented thoroughly in accordance with department protocols.

Narrative:  
On November 21, 2025, at approximately 16:56 hours, I, Sgt. Salazar, along with P.O. Keane, responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at Lakeside Park, specifically at the boat dock bench area. Upon arrival, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Hannah,” who provided a brief account of the incident.

“Hannah” stated that an individual had held her waist against her will. She reported that she verbally expressed her refusal by saying “No, stop,” to which the individual allegedly responded, “Just a sec.” Following this interaction, she indicated that she left the area. No further details regarding the suspect’s identity or description were provided at the scene.

During the interview, I assessed the nature of the alleged contact. It was noted that the physical interaction did not involve force that left any visible marks or signs of restraint. The absence of injury or physical compulsion was documented. Additionally, environmental factors such as wind and water noise were considered, which may have affected the suspect’s awareness of the complainant’s verbal refusal.

Efforts to corroborate the complainant’s account were limited. No canvass of nearby fishermen or other potential witnesses was conducted, and no surveillance cameras were identified or reviewed in the vicinity. Furthermore, the complainant declined or was not offered a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination or related victim resources at the time of the report.

Based on the information gathered and the lack of physical evidence or witness corroboration, the incident was evaluated under the applicable legal standards. The absence of force, injury, or clear compulsion, combined with ambiguous knowledge on the part of the alleged offender, led to the determination that the report did not meet the criteria for a prosecutable offense.

At approximately 17:47 hours, the scene was cleared, and the case was classified as unfounded. The complainant was advised of available support services despite the case disposition. All actions and observations were documented in accordance with department protocol.

Case Number: 141  
Date of Incident: November 21, 2025  
Time on Scene: 22:02 to 22:56  
Location: Staff Locker Corridor, [Name of Restaurant]  
Reporting Officer: P.O. Ebner (#2339)  
Assisting Officer: P.O. Fox (#2577)  
Weather Conditions: Cloudy, 69°F

Narrative:

On November 21, 2025, at approximately 22:02 hours, Officers Ebner and Fox responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the staff locker corridor of [Name of Restaurant]. Upon arrival, I, Officer Ebner, made contact with the reporting party, identified as Camila, an employee at the establishment.

Camila stated that after the restaurant had closed, an individual touched her chest without consent. She reported that she immediately said “No” and left the area. The incident reportedly occurred in a kitchen corridor, which is known to be a crowded and busy area during shift changes and closing times.

During the interview, I sought to clarify the circumstances surrounding the alleged contact. I explained that in such crowded corridors, brief physical contact can sometimes be incidental. Therefore, I inquired about any signs of restraint, injury, or resistance. Camila denied any physical injury or marks resulting from the contact and stated that she did not shout or call for help at the time.

Further questioning revealed that some co-workers had teased the involved individual, suggesting that the contact may have been unintentional or without malicious intent. There was no evidence to suggest deliberate compulsion or incapacitation on the part of the suspect.

The investigation was limited by the absence of CCTV footage covering the corridor area and no witnesses came forward to corroborate the report. Additionally, no photographic evidence was available, and the victim declined or was unable to access Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) services or other medical resources.

Based on the information gathered, there was no indication of physical injury, force, or incapacitation. The mens rea, or intent, behind the contact remained ambiguous. Given these factors, the incident was assessed as an administrative matter rather than a criminal offense requiring further prosecution.

The officers cleared the scene at approximately 22:56 hours after completing the preliminary investigation and documentation. Camila was advised on her options for follow-up and support services.

Secondary Officer: P.O. Kravitz (#2902)  
Location: 700 Grand Hotel, Room 605  
Time on Scene: 21:04:18 – 21:57:50  
Weather: Cloudy, 70°F  

Narrative:  
On November 22, 2025, at approximately 21:04 hours, Officers Doyle and Kravitz responded to a sexual assault report at the 700 Grand Hotel, Room 605. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as Lena, was present and provided a statement regarding the incident.

Lena reported that after consuming drinks at the hotel bar, an individual placed his hand inside her dress without her consent. She stated that she verbally said “No” when this occurred and that the individual attempted the same action once more. At that point, she indicated to the door, signaling her desire for the individual to leave. Lena did not report any physical injuries resulting from the encounter.

During the interview, Officer Doyle assessed the situation and noted the context of prior flirtation between the parties at the bar. Doyle expressed that the initial “no” could be interpreted as mixed messaging in the context of flirtation and emphasized that for the incident to be prosecutable, evidence of force or restraint would be necessary. The officer further inquired about any injuries, but none were reported or observed.

The investigation did not include a review of keycard logs or hallway surveillance footage, nor were any witnesses interviewed at the scene. Additionally, no Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was conducted, and the complainant was not provided with resources or referrals for support services.

Based on the information gathered, Officer Doyle summarized that the elements required to pursue prosecution were lacking. Specifically, there was no indication of force, restraint, or injury, and the context of flirtation complicated the interpretation of consent. Consequently, the case was classified as non-prosecutable at that time.

Officers cleared the scene at 21:57 hours. The complainant was advised of her options should she choose to pursue the matter further in the future.

Narrative:

On November 22, 2025, at approximately 07:06 hours, Officers Li (#2631) and Gomez (#2740) responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the Riverwalk, specifically under the bridge at mile marker 1.8. Upon arrival, the weather was noted as breezy with a temperature of 75°F.

The complainant, identified as “June,” stated that an individual had touched her by the railing. She reported that she immediately said “No, stop,” and stepped away from the individual. June described the contact as unwanted but did not indicate that she was physically restrained or injured during the incident.

During the interview, Officer Li explained the legal standards applicable to the situation, emphasizing that unless the suspect had restrained or physically harmed June, the incident might not meet the criteria outlined in the sexual assault statute. Officer Li further clarified that the suspect’s acknowledgment of June’s refusal was ambiguous, and the mens rea, or criminal intent, was unsettled based on the information provided.

No physical evidence was collected at the scene, and June declined or was not offered a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination or additional victim resources. The absence of physical injury, compulsion, or clear acknowledgment of non-consent led the officers to conclude that the incident did not constitute a criminal offense under current statutes.

The officers documented the complainant’s statement and the circumstances surrounding the event. The case was summarized as non-criminal due to the lack of compulsion, injury, and ambiguous knowledge of the suspect’s intent. The scene was cleared at 08:00 hours.

No further investigative actions were taken at this time. The complainant was advised of her rights and available support services should she choose to pursue them in the future.

Narrative:

On November 23, 2025, at approximately 20:56 hours, Officers Hwang and Cutter responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at 118 Harbor View, Apartment 3C. Upon arrival, officers made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Ava,” who alleged that an individual had touched her after she had said no and asked him to leave.

During the initial interview, Ava stated, “He touched me after I said no and I told him to leave.” Officer Hwang inquired further about the nature of the contact and the circumstances surrounding the alleged assault. Ava acknowledged that there had been a prior consensual kiss with the individual involved. Officer Hwang explained that consent had initially existed but noted that revocation of consent must be clear and beyond a simple verbal “no” to establish non-consensual conduct under the law.

Further questioning addressed whether any force or compulsion was involved. Ava was asked if there had been any struggle or if she had been held down during the incident. She responded negatively to both questions, indicating no physical restraint or coercion had occurred.

Officers also inquired about any physical evidence that might support the claim, such as photographs, CCTV footage, witnesses, or text messages. Ava indicated that no such evidence was available. The absence of physical evidence or witnesses was noted, and these factors were labeled as “not probative” in the investigation.

Additionally, Ava declined or was not provided with Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) resources, and no medical examination was conducted at the scene or subsequently.

Based on the information gathered, the officers summarized the incident as follows: there was no indication of physical restraint, injury, or incapacitation; prior intimacy between the parties was established; and the mental state (mens rea) of the accused was uncertain. Given these factors, the officers concluded that the allegations did not meet the criteria for a criminal sexual assault under current statutes.

The case was therefore classified as unfounded. Officers cleared the scene at 21:50 hours without further action.

Time on Scene: 17:18:44 to 18:09:36  
Weather: Sunny, 84°F  

On November 23, 2025, at approximately 17:18 hours, Officers Gomez and Li responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at 77 Redwood Office Park, specifically at Stairwell B Landing. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as “Rosa,” provided a statement concerning the incident.

Rosa stated that an individual touched her inappropriately. She recalled saying “Stop” and subsequently leaving the area on Level 3 of the stairwell. During the interview, Rosa described the contact but did not indicate any physical injury or signs of restraint. She also did not report any compulsion or force used during the interaction.

Officer Gomez noted that the relationship between the parties involved was characterized by a work rapport, which appeared to cloud the clarity of the complainant’s knowledge or perception of the event. Given the absence of physical injury, restraint, or clear evidence of compulsion, the statutory requirements for a criminal sexual assault charge were not met.

No evidence collection or Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination was conducted, as the complainant declined or the circumstances did not warrant such procedures. The officers summarized the incident as administrative in nature due to the ambiguous knowledge of the complainant and lack of physical evidence or injury.

The officers remained on scene until 18:09 hours, ensuring that all necessary information was documented and that the complainant was informed of available resources and reporting options. The case was classified as an administrative report, with no further criminal action recommended at this time.

Narrative:

On November 24, 2025, at approximately 10:16 hours, Sergeant Kim and Officer Alvarado responded to a report of a sexual assault at Office Suite 610, specifically in the Quiet Room. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as “Maya,” was present and provided a statement regarding the incident.

Maya reported that an individual had touched her in the phone room after she had explicitly said “no.” She described the contact as unwanted and non-consensual. The complainant did not indicate any physical injury or restraint during the encounter. Maya declined to provide additional evidence such as badge identification, CCTV footage, email headers, or witness information, citing that the intent behind the contact was not visible or clear.

During the interview, Sergeant Kim explained that without evidence of restraint or injury, the incident did not meet the criminal threshold for sexual assault under current statutes. Maya was informed of available resources, including Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) services, but she declined these offers.

The officers conducted a thorough assessment of the situation, noting the absence of force, injury, or other elements typically required to substantiate a criminal sexual assault charge. It was also noted that there was a prior rapport between the complainant and the individual involved, which was taken into consideration during the evaluation.

After approximately 50 minutes on scene, the officers concluded their investigation with a summary stating that the elements necessary to proceed with criminal charges were lacking. The complainant was advised of her rights and options moving forward.

The scene was cleared at 11:06 hours.

No further action was taken at this time due to insufficient evidence to support criminal charges. The case remains documented for record-keeping and potential future reference.

Narrative:  
On November 24, 2025, at approximately 16:04 hours, Officers Ortega and Wynn responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at City Beach, specifically at the Dune Path 3 bench. Upon arrival, officers made contact with the reporting party, identified as Aria, who alleged that she had been kissed and touched by an individual after she had verbally indicated for the contact to stop.

During the initial interview, Aria stated, “We kissed; he touched me after I said stop.” Officer Ortega engaged in a detailed conversation to clarify the circumstances surrounding the incident. It was established that there had been prior consensual intimacy between Aria and the individual in question. However, Aria claimed that the touching continued after she expressed her desire for it to cease.

Officer Ortega explained to Aria that prior consent to intimacy complicates the classification of subsequent touching as criminal unless there is evidence of force or compulsion. The officer assessed the situation for any signs of physical injury or restraint and found none. Aria did not exhibit any visible injuries, nor did she report any physical coercion or force during the encounter.

Further investigation revealed no physical evidence to support the claim of non-consensual touching. Aria declined a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination, and no forensic evidence was collected at the scene. The officers documented the interaction thoroughly, noting the absence of physical evidence or injuries.

Based on the information provided and the lack of physical evidence or signs of force, Officer Ortega concluded that the elements necessary to classify the incident as a criminal sexual assault were not present. The summary of the investigation was recorded as “Prior intimacy; no compulsion; ambiguous knowledge,” indicating that while there was prior consensual contact, the subsequent touching did not meet the legal threshold for criminal action due to the absence of force or clear non-consent.

The officers cleared the scene at 16:59 hours, having completed all necessary documentation and ensuring that Aria was informed of her options should she decide to pursue further action in the future.

No arrests were made, and the case remains open pending any additional evidence or reports. The reporting officers remain available for follow-up as needed.

Call Type: Sexual Assault Report  

Narrative:

On November 25, 2025, at approximately 18:10 hours, Officers Ebner and Fox responded to a sexual assault report at 60 Orchard Co-Op, Room 3B. Upon arrival, the complainant, identified as “Piper,” reported an incident involving unwanted physical contact. According to the complainant, the alleged assailant made contact with her under-shirt area despite her verbal indication that she did not want to engage in sexual activity.

During the initial interview, Officer Ebner noted that the complainant described the contact as unwanted and that she had explicitly communicated her lack of consent. The complainant stated that the contact occurred after she had clearly expressed that she did not want sex. Officer Ebner referenced legal standards regarding consent, stating that an invitation to engage in sexual activity implies consent, but that such consent must be unmistakably revoked to be considered withdrawn.

Further assessment revealed that there was no evidence of physical resistance or injury to the complainant. The absence of injury or resistance bars was noted, which are typically considered in evaluating the credibility of sexual assault claims. Additionally, there was no corroborating evidence or forensic examination conducted, as the complainant did not undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) evaluation.

Based on the information gathered during the interview and the lack of physical evidence or corroboration, the officers summarized the case as involving no force or injury, with doubtful knowledge of non-consent. The circumstances did not support the elements required to substantiate a sexual assault under the applicable legal standards.

Consequently, the case was classified as unfounded due to insufficient evidence to proceed with charges. The complainant was informed of the decision and provided with resources for support and counseling. Officers remained on scene until 19:02 hours, ensuring the complainant’s safety and addressing any further concerns.

No further action was taken at this time. The case file was closed pending any new information or evidence that may arise.

Elise stated that the alleged incident occurred in a private study room at the library involving peers. She described the encounter as consensual in nature, with no use of force or compulsion involved. Elise’s account indicated that the interaction took place in a private setting without any physical injury or signs of trauma. The officers noted that the circumstances described fell outside the statute of limitations for prosecuting a sexual assault case.

During the interview, Elise repeated her account consistently. Officer Hwang summarized the situation, noting the absence of compulsion or injury and the ambiguous nature of knowledge regarding the incident. No physical evidence or forensic examination was conducted or collected at the scene, as the report and circumstances did not warrant such measures.

On November 26, 2025, at approximately 17:24 hours, I, Sergeant Salazar, along with Officer Keane, responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at City Market, Service Hall E. Upon arrival, the area was observed to be crowded, with numerous bystanders present. The weather was hot, approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

The complainant, identified as Kara, reported that an individual had grabbed her near the mop sink within the service hall. According to her statement, she immediately said “No” to the individual’s actions. Kara did not indicate any physical injury resulting from the incident. The environment was busy, and no visible signs of struggle or injury were noted at the scene.

During the initial assessment, I noted that the incident occurred in a public and crowded area, which was consistent with the complainant’s account. Kara’s description suggested non-consensual contact; however, there was no evidence of physical force or injury. The nature of the contact was classified as harassment (HR) based on the circumstances and the complainant’s report.

No corroborating witnesses were identified at the scene, and no Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) was present or requested at the time of the report. The complainant declined medical examination or further forensic evaluation.

After reviewing the details, the summary of the incident was documented as involving no force or injury, with ambiguous mens rea regarding the intent of the accused. The lack of physical evidence and corroboration limited the ability to pursue further immediate action.

The scene was cleared at 18:15 hours after ensuring the complainant’s safety and providing information on available support services. Kara was advised on how to follow up with the department and seek additional assistance if needed.

This report will be submitted for further review and potential investigation pending any new evidence or witness statements.
