On April 6, 2025, at approximately 02:06 hours, I, Police Officer Patel (#5123), along with Secondary Officer Nguyen (#4419), responded to a reported sexual assault at the rear parking lot of 1190 N. Cedar Ave., City of Foxridge. The weather was light rain with a temperature of 47°F. Upon arrival, we observed a gray four-door sedan parked with the rear passenger door slightly ajar. A female adult, later identified as Ari [last name withheld], was seated on the curb near the vehicle, wrapped in a blanket provided by her friend, Kira [last name withheld], who stood nearby.

I introduced myself and informed Ari that we were recording on our body cameras and asked for her consent to speak on scene, which she granted. Ari appeared alert and oriented, with steady breathing and no visible external injuries on her face or forearms. She reported soreness in her inner thighs. Kira confirmed she had called 911 at 02:01 after receiving a distressed phone call from Ari at 01:58.

Ari stated that the suspect, identified as Luis, a coworker, had put her in the backseat of the vehicle against her will. She described how Luis had offered to walk her to her car after leaving a bar around 01:35. Upon arrival at the parking lot, Luis asked to sit in the car, but Ari expressed her desire to leave. Luis then opened the back door and nudged her inside despite her repeated verbal refusals, saying “stop” and “no.” Ari attempted to push him away, and she said, “He held my wrists.” She described Luis as a Hispanic male in his mid-30s, approximately 5’10” with a medium build, wearing a navy jacket, jeans, and a black cap. Luis was last seen leaving the lot in a dark SUV around 01:55.

We requested EMS for a medical evaluation and a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam at the hospital. Ari consented to officers photographing the interior of the vehicle prior to EMS arrival. Upon inspection, the gray sedan’s back seat fabric was torn approximately four inches at the center seam, and tissue paper was found on the floorboard. A condom wrapper was located near the rear passenger footwell. The vehicle’s license plate was partially obscured by mud, and a temporary paper permit was visible inside the rear window. The permit was later confirmed to be tied to dealership inventory and not registered to Ari.

I canvassed the area and spoke with the night attendant at a nearby laundromat, who agreed to request CCTV footage covering the time frame from 01:30 to 02:10. The footage could potentially capture Luis’s departure in the dark SUV.

At 02:11, EMS arrived, and the lead paramedic, Renee, explained the medical and forensic options to Ari, who elected to proceed with the SANE exam. Ari consented to leave the vehicle in place and to the release of the sexual assault kit to law enforcement after the exam.

At the hospital, the sexual assault kit and clothing items (black leggings, gray hoodie, and underwear) were sealed and received by Officer Nguyen at 02:47. The evidence was logged into the CAD and evidence module accordingly. An advocate arrived at 02:58 to provide support to Ari.

We cleared the hospital at 03:03, concluding our involvement. The victim’s identity was verified, direct quotes were documented, and photographic evidence of the vehicle interior was collected with consent. No physical evidence was collected on scene due to weather conditions and pending the SANE exam. Follow-up actions include reviewing CCTV footage and continuing the investigation into the suspect Luis.

On April 9, 2025, at approximately 19:36 hours, I, Sgt. R. Salazar (#2081), along with P.O. Keane (#3775), responded to a sexual assault report at 601 E. Brookside, Unit 12. The weather was overcast with a temperature of 56°F. Upon arrival, we proceeded to the third-floor landing and knocked on the door of Unit 12. A female voice invited us in.

Upon entry, with the victim’s consent, I observed the living room to be neat and the bedroom door open. The victim identified herself as Elena [last name withheld], and I recorded her date of birth and phone number. Elena was seated at the dining table, wrapped in a blanket around her shoulders. She reported soreness in her hips and lower back but showed no visible external injuries on her face or forearms.

Elena stated that the incident occurred between 2:00 and 2:20 p.m. earlier that day. She described waking up to find a male, identified as Tyler, her roommate’s friend, on top of her. She said, “I said ‘No, stop,’” and that she pushed at him. She further explained that he covered her mouth with his hand for a few seconds. Elena emphasized that she did not consent to the contact and that she said “Stop” three times while trying to move away.

Her roommate, Marissa, was present and provided contact information. Marissa stated that Tyler left the apartment around 14:30. She described Tyler as a white male, approximately 23 years old, 5’11” tall, medium build, with brown hair and a small triangle tattoo on his wrist. Marissa also offered to provide Tyler’s Instagram profile and phone number.

With Elena’s consent, I inspected the bedroom. The queen bed had the duvet pulled halfway off, the fitted sheet was rumpled, and a pillow was on the floor next to the east side nightstand. In the bathroom, I observed cotton swabs and tissue with apparent blood on the sink. Elena consented to photographs of these items, which I took, but collection was deferred to the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) team.

Elena reported that she changed her shirt after the incident and that the original shirt was in the laundry basket. She had not showered since the assault. P.O. Keane documented the clothing worn: a T-shirt and sweatpants.

I canvassed the hallway and spoke with a neighbor, Daria from Unit 11, who reported hearing a muffled voice around 14:10 but could not identify the words. She provided her contact number for follow-up.

At 19:39, I confirmed with dispatch that Elena had called 911 at 18:59. EMS arrived shortly after, and Elena agreed to be transported to Memorial Medical Center for evaluation and a forensic exam by the SANE team. An advocate was requested to assist Elena.

I contacted building management to request hallway camera footage but was informed that cameras only cover the lobby. I requested preservation of lobby footage from 13:30 to 15:00 and from 18:30 to 19:30.

Elena consented to the release of the forensic kit to law enforcement. We provided her with a Victim Rights pamphlet and instructions on preserving evidence. EMS transported Elena and Marissa to the hospital at 19:41.

At Memorial Medical Center, officers remained outside the exam room while the SANE exam was conducted. At 20:18, we received Sexual Assault Kit #MMC-25-0409-142, along with Clothing Bag A containing sweatpants and Clothing Bag B containing the original shirt retrieved from the laundry in a sealed bag via EMS. Officer Keane took custody of the evidence at 20:18:33.

I emailed the Detective Unit with suspect identifiers and the social media link provided by Marissa. The lobby footage preservation request was also emailed to building management. We cleared the hospital at 20:28.

On April 12, 2025, at approximately 23:09 hours, I, Police Officer Martinez (#4217), along with Officer Chin (#3364), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault at 410 S. Pine St., Unit 7. The weather was clear with a temperature of 61°F. Upon arrival, we proceeded to the third-floor exterior corridor and knocked on the door marked “7.” A female voice responded, “It’s open,” and we entered with her consent.

Inside, we found the victim, who identified herself as Nadia [last name withheld], seated on the floor near a coffee table, wrapped in a hoodie. She provided her date of birth and phone number for the report. Nadia appeared visibly distressed and stated, “I told him no and he kept going.” She identified the suspect as Sean [first name], a co-worker from the marketing team.

Nadia reported the incident occurred around 10:40 p.m. in her bedroom. Upon observation, I noted redness approximately 1 cm in diameter on the inner right wrist, which I photographed with her consent. No other visible injuries were observed on her face or hands. I offered emergency medical services, which she accepted. Officer Chin immediately radioed EMS and requested a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) to respond.

With Nadia’s consent, we conducted a scene assessment. The bedroom door was open; the bed sheet was rumpled, and a lamp was knocked over but the bulb remained intact. Nadia described the sequence of events: Sean came over to drop off her laptop charger, and they had wine in the kitchen. He attempted to kiss her, which she declined. He then followed her to the bedroom, pushed her onto the bed, and despite her saying “Stop” and attempting to get up, he continued. She emphatically stated, “I did not consent.”

A neighbor from Unit 9, identified as Tina, reported hearing a loud thud around 10:45 p.m. but did not see anyone leave the unit. I provided Nadia with evidence preservation guidance; she confirmed she had not showered or changed clothes. Her clothing—a black dress and cardigan—was documented but not collected at the scene pending the SANE examination.

I requested building lobby surveillance footage from 9:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. via an emailed preservation notice. Nadia showed me text messages from Sean, including one at 9:58 p.m. stating, “I’ll swing by with the charger.” She also reported that Sean said, “Don’t make this a thing,” when she told him to stop. Officer Chin documented these quotes verbatim.

EMS arrived at 23:12 hours, and an advocate was requested. Nadia consented to release the sexual assault kit to law enforcement following the medical exam. I issued her a case card and explained the investigative process and her rights. EMS transported Nadia to Foxridge General SART for further examination.

At 23:36 hours, I received the Sexual Assault Kit #FGH-25-0412-224, along with two clothing bags containing the dress and cardigan. The swabs were collected by the SANE nurse. I logged the chain of custody at 23:36:35. Confirmation of the lobby footage request was received under management system ticket #PM-88214.

On April 14, 2025, at approximately 16:43 hours, I, Police Officer Doyle (#3198), along with Officer Kravitz (#2902), responded to a sexual assault report at the Campus Quad near the Library Steps. The weather was windy with a temperature of 52°F. Upon arrival, we located the victim, identified as Jada [last name withheld], seated on a bench accompanied by her friend Kellie.

After informing Jada that the interaction was being recorded and obtaining her consent to speak on the record, she disclosed that a classmate had assaulted her in her dorm room the previous night. She stated the incident occurred between 01:30 and 01:50 hours. Jada described that she repeatedly told the suspect “No, stop,” but he covered her mouth momentarily to silence her.

During the initial assessment, I observed a small linear redness approximately 0.5 cm in length on her left cheek near the hairline. With her permission, I photographed the injury for documentation. Given the nature of the report, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were requested, and Jada consented to undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination.

With Jada’s consent, we proceeded to Dorm A, Room 214, to document the scene. Upon entering the room, I noted rumpled bed linens and a tipped desk chair, but no visible damage to property. Jada recounted the sequence of events: she and the suspect had been studying in the lounge when he offered to walk her back to her dorm. He asked to come inside, to which she agreed for a brief moment. She stated that he kissed her, which she rejected by pulling away and verbally expressing her lack of consent. Inside the room, the suspect pushed her onto the bed despite her protests and commands to stop.

Jada provided a description of the suspect as Marcus [last name withheld], a classmate from her chemistry class, approximately 6’1” tall, wearing a black hoodie and gray joggers. We spoke with the dorm Resident Assistant, Devon, who reported seeing a tall male exit the hallway near that time, though he could not positively identify the individual.

I contacted campus security to request video footage from hallway cameras covering the timeframe of 01:00 to 02:30 hours to assist in the investigation. Jada confirmed she had not showered since the assault but had changed her T-shirt at 09:00 that morning. The original T-shirt was located in her hamper; however, collection was deferred to the SANE team to preserve evidence integrity.

Throughout the interview, Jada consistently stated phrases such as “I said ‘No, stop,’” “I tried to push him away,” and “I did not consent.” A campus advocacy center representative was contacted and arrived to provide support to Jada.

EMS transported Jada to University Hospital’s Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) unit for a forensic medical examination. At 17:12, I received the Sexual Assault Kit (#UH-25-0414-302) along with two clothing bags containing her shorts and the original T-shirt sealed by the SANE nurse. Officer Kravitz took custody of the evidence at 17:13.

I promptly emailed the campus police investigations unit with the suspect’s information and the camera footage request to facilitate further inquiry. The advocate remained with Jada during the hospital stay. At 18:01, Officer Kravitz and I cleared the hospital, concluding our involvement for the evening.

All actions were conducted in accordance with department protocols to ensure victim support, evidence preservation, and thorough investigation. The case remains open pending review of video evidence and suspect follow-up.",,0.04567736185383244,0.39104278074866317,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,

On April 16, 2025, at approximately 21:12 hours, I, Police Officer Gomez (#2740), along with Officer Li (#2631), responded to a report of a sexual assault at the Level 2 parking structure, Bay D-12. The weather was clear with a temperature of 48°F. Upon arrival, we located the victim, identified as Miriam [last name withheld], standing near a silver hatchback vehicle accompanied by her friend, Noor.

I informed Miriam that we were recording and asked for her consent to speak, which she granted. Miriam reported that she had been assaulted in the back seat of the vehicle approximately one hour prior, placing the incident between 20:10 and 20:20. Dispatch confirmed a 911 call was placed at 20:58. Miriam appeared alert and coherent, with no visible injuries, but she reported experiencing nausea and a headache.

Miriam described the assault, stating she repeatedly said “Please stop” and attempted to move away from the suspect. She identified the suspect as her ex-boyfriend, Daniel, who was last seen leaving the scene in a blue sedan around 20:25. I requested and received consent to photograph the interior of the vehicle. Observations included a jacket, tissue, and hair tie on the back seat, a twisted seatbelt, and a condom wrapper on the floor behind the driver’s seat. Photographs were taken for documentation; however, no evidence was collected at the scene.

I canvassed the area for surveillance cameras and confirmed that the parking structure is equipped with CCTV at entry and exit points. Contact was made with the security office, and a request was placed to preserve footage from 19:45 to 20:45. Security guard Alan confirmed that the cameras record vehicle exits and agreed to preserve the relevant footage.

Noor stated that Miriam called her immediately after the suspect left and asked her to come to the location. Miriam reiterated that she did not consent to any sexual activity. Officer Li requested EMS, and Miriam agreed to be transported for a hospital evaluation and Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam. Miriam’s clothing was documented as jeans and a sweatshirt; she had not changed or showered since the incident. Miriam also provided a text message thread with Daniel, dated 19:55, in which he asked, “Meet at garage?” She consented to a screenshot of this conversation.

EMS arrived at 21:15 hours, and an advocate was requested to assist Miriam. EMS transported her to Foxridge General Hospital’s Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) unit. At 21:41, I received the Sexual Assault Kit (#FGH-25-0416-411) and two sealed clothing bags containing Miriam’s jeans and underwear. Chain of custody was established and documented. Officer Li emailed the Investigations Unit with suspect information and requested the security footage from the garage.

At 22:06 hours, both officers cleared the hospital, concluding our involvement in this incident.

On April 18, 2025, at approximately 3:24 a.m., I, Police Officer Yates (#3504), along with secondary officer P.O. Brower (#3512), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault at 118 Baxter Avenue. The weather was drizzly with a temperature of 45°F. Upon arrival, we approached the rear entry of the single-family home and were granted consent to enter by the resident, identified as Lena [last name withheld].

Inside the rear bedroom, Lena reported that an individual named Evan, an acquaintance from a social gathering earlier that evening at the same residence, had pushed her onto the bed without her consent. She stated clearly, “He pushed me onto the bed. I said no,” and further emphasized, “I said ‘No, stop,’” and “He held my wrists.” Lena reported experiencing wrist pain but showed no visible injuries on her face or hands. Upon inspection, I observed the bed linens were disturbed, a pillow was on the floor, and the bedside lamp remained upright.

Lena estimated the incident occurred around 2:55 a.m. Housemate Mitch, present at the scene, corroborated the timeline by stating he saw a male run out the back door at approximately 3:05 a.m. I requested emergency medical services (EMS) and Lena consented to a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination. Officer Brower photographed the bedroom with Lena’s consent; however, no physical evidence was collected at that time pending the SANE examination.

Lena confirmed she had not changed clothes since the incident, wearing a T-shirt and shorts, which were documented for evidence. EMS arrived promptly, and an advocate was requested to assist Lena. Following the medical examination, Lena was transported to Memorial SART for further evaluation and evidence collection.

At 3:54 a.m., I received the Sexual Assault Kit labeled #MMC-25-0418-059, along with two clothing bags containing the T-shirt and shorts worn by Lena. Officer Brower took custody of the evidence at 3:54:41 a.m., maintaining the chain of custody. I also obtained contact information from a neighbor who agreed to provide exterior camera footage covering the timeframe between 2:30 a.m. and 3:15 a.m. This footage was requested to be digitally transferred to the Evidence Unit inbox for review.

The entire incident was documented thoroughly, including direct quotes from Lena and observations of the scene. Officers cleared the scene at 4:18 a.m. The investigation remains open pending review of the video evidence and further forensic analysis.

On September 4, 2025, at approximately 21:07 hours, I, Officer Reyes (#2147), along with Officer Malik (#3052), responded to a call classified as a Sexual Assault Report at 118 Harbor View, Apartment 3C. The weather was clear with a temperature of 74°F. Upon arrival, we activated our body-worn cameras in the hallway and announced our presence.

At 21:07:26, the resident, identified as Ava, opened the door and stepped back to allow us entry. Her voice was calm but noticeably shaky. I introduced myself and Officer Malik, offering Ava water, a seat, or a blanket to ensure her comfort. She nodded toward the couch and accepted a blanket that was visible nearby. After obtaining her consent to record the conversation, I informed her she could request a break at any time.

The living room was scanned for evidence; two cups, a phone, and tissues were on the coffee table, and the bedroom door was closed. I invited Ava to share her account in her own words. She disclosed that the suspect was a coworker who came over to drop off a charger. During their interaction, she told him to stop, becoming tearful as she recounted the events.

I offered tissues and normalized her reactions, emphasizing that she controlled the conversation. Ava described saying “no, this isn’t okay” and attempting to push his hand away. I documented her exact phrasing and gestures. Officer Malik photographed the scene with her verbal consent, capturing the living room, hallway, and bedroom threshold from multiple angles to preserve the context.

I explained the availability of a Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SAFE), emphasizing it was free, could include an advocate, and did not obligate her to press charges. Ava expressed her desire to proceed with the exam. I requested medical dispatch for a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) and logged the time.

Ava provided a timeline: the suspect arrived around 19:30, they had tea and discussed a project, after which he kissed her without consent. She said “no,” but he persisted by placing his hand under her waistband. She moved away, told him to leave, but he blocked her path before eventually leaving at 20:20, taking the charger. Ava recalled the suspect saying, “Don’t make it weird,” and noted he wore a blue hoodie.

I advised Ava not to bathe or change clothes if possible until the exam and offered paper bags for clothing if changed. She was still wearing the same jeans and top. A paper sheet was provided for seating. Ava consented to provide digital evidence by emailing screenshots of texts from the suspect, including an apology message. Officers photographed the screen to document time, date, and contact information.

We discussed potential witnesses; Ava mentioned a neighbor named Liam who might have seen the suspect leave. She preferred to contact him later. Officer Malik canvassed the adjacent apartment (3B) but received no response, leaving a contact card.

Ava was intermittently tearful but coherent and oriented. She reported hip soreness but had no visible injuries. EMS was offered but declined; she requested to attend the SANE facility. Safety planning included discussing the suspect’s expected presence at her workplace and offering a protective order referral. Ava requested an advocate, and with her permission, I connected her to the advocacy hotline on speakerphone.

Suspect information was partially known, including name, description, and vehicle plate. I contacted the property manager via after-hours line and sent a time-stamped email requesting building CCTV footage from 19:15 to 20:45.

Chain of custody procedures were initiated; evidence envelopes were labeled but not sealed on camera, to be sealed at the station if clothing was provided post-exam. Miranda rights were deemed not applicable as no suspect was present. Throughout the interview, I avoided leading questions or clarifying contradictions, focusing on Ava’s account.

Ava requested a break at 21:25; questioning paused, and officers remained present. Upon resuming, she expressed her wish to proceed with the exam and decide on charges afterward. Transport to the SANE facility was arranged, with an advocate to meet her there. I explained the option of a blind kit if she remained undecided about reporting.

A closing summary was read back, including times of arrival and departure, statements, physical interactions, requests for the suspect to leave, suspect clothing, and messages received. Ava confirmed the accuracy of the summary. We provided her with the case number, a contact card, victim rights information, and a resource list.

Officer Malik secured the scene with final photographs. I logged evidence requests for building CCTV, potential phone extraction warrants (subject to consent or warrant), and planned an interview request for the suspect in a controlled setting at a later date.

Ava chose to stay with a friend; officers arranged for her friend’s pickup. We departed the scene at 21:50. The entire response was conducted using a trauma-informed approach, emphasizing evidence preservation and victim support. The body-worn camera was deactivated at 22:01:55.

The weather was noted as light rain with a temperature of 66°F. Upon arrival, we located the complainant, identified as Mina, seated at covered picnic tables alongside her friend, Jess. Mina was wrapped in a foil blanket provided by a bystander EMT.

After introductions, I offered Mina the option to move to our patrol cruiser for warmth or remain at the pavilion. She chose to proceed to the cruiser. Upon securing her consent to record the interview and acknowledging her right to pause at any time, I initiated grounding techniques, including paced breathing, to help her remain calm. I reassured her that she was not in trouble and emphasized that she controlled what information she wished to share.

Mina provided a free narrative of the incident, stating that she met the suspect near the food trucks following a concert. They walked toward a nearby path where the suspect kissed her. She communicated her lack of interest in further contact by saying “no” twice and expressing a desire to return, to which the suspect responded, “just a minute.” Despite her refusals, he persisted.

I sought clarification without judgment, asking Mina to recall the exact words exchanged. She reiterated her verbal refusals and described the suspect’s response. Mina provided a physical description of the suspect, including approximate height, clothing details, and a baseball cap with a team logo. She identified the timeline as occurring between 22:15 and 22:30 under the pedestrian bridge near the park. Mina recounted pushing the suspect’s hands away and reported that he squeezed her wrist.

A physical injury check revealed soreness in Mina’s wrist and a scrape on her knee, which she attributed to stepping off a curb during the incident. With her consent, we photographed the injuries using a scale ruler and color card for documentation.

I advised Mina on the benefits and limitations of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam and offered the assistance of an advocate and transport to a clinic. Mina consented to the exam but declined hospital transport. EMS personnel checked her vital signs and confirmed her stable condition.

We noted that the ongoing rain could affect trace evidence and planned an early area canvas. Jess, who witnessed Mina’s return upset at approximately 22:40, provided a brief statement; a full interview was deferred. I coordinated with dispatch to flag city CCTV footage from Riverfront Gate and the food truck line for retention.

Mina recalled the suspect saying, “You’re so tense, relax,” during the encounter. I sketched a map of the route with Mina’s input, which was photographed for the record. There was no reported contact with the suspect following the incident.

We discussed safety planning with Mina, including arrangements for rides home, sharing her location with friends, and procedures if the suspect reappears. Language access services were not required as Mina’s primary language is English.

No immediate suspect was located, and no detentions or stops were conducted without a matching description and legal basis. We canvassed the area, speaking with food truck vendors who recalled a man wearing a navy windbreaker. One vendor directed us to a private camera mounted on a truck; the owner consented to share the footage, and contact information was collected with a signed consent form.

Environmental conditions included rain runoff near the path, where mud prints were photographed with and without scale but not seized pending Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) arrival. Mina requested a break during questioning, which was honored; ambient audio was recorded without probing.

Upon resuming, Mina expressed concern that her initial interaction with the suspect might be misunderstood. I affirmed that her earlier choices did not negate her verbal refusals or consent. Documentation emphasized Mina’s verbal refusals, physical resistance, the sequence of events, and suspect statements.

I reviewed the victim rights sheet with Mina, provided the case number, and explained how to obtain records. Transport to the affiliated clinic was coordinated, with an advocate meeting Mina at the entrance; her friend traveled separately.

Potential evidence was secured and yellow barrier tape was placed around the scene with Parks Department approval. Dispatch confirmed initiation of city camera footage retention.

A brief debrief between officers ensured the report contained no leading language and that statements were quoted verbatim. At 07:34 hours, we cleared the scene after confirming Mina’s safe departure. The entire incident response concluded at 07:38 hours.

On September 5, 2025, at approximately 17:22 hours, I, Officer Li (#2631), accompanied by Officer Gomez (#2740), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at 77 Redwood Office Park, specifically at Stairwell B Landing. The weather was sunny with a temperature of 82°F. Upon arrival, building security was present at the scene.

We found the complainant, identified as Rosa, a woman in her mid-30s, seated on a step at the mid-level landing, visibly upset and clutching her phone. After introducing myself and explaining our role, I offered Rosa the choice of location for the interview. She preferred to move to an empty conference room on the third floor for privacy and comfort.

With Rosa’s consent, I began recording the interview and explained the purpose of the recording. Rosa provided a free narrative account, stating that she works on the fourth floor and that the suspect had cornered her between the third and fourth floors. She described how the suspect put his hand on her despite her clear verbal objection, saying “stop.” She emphasized that she had told him to stop and that she needed to return to work.

Rosa clarified that prior interactions with the suspect had been cordial but strictly professional, with no romantic involvement. She recounted the suspect’s exact words during the incident: “Don’t act like you don’t want it,” which Officer Gomez documented verbatim. Rosa pointed out the exact location on the stairwell where the incident occurred, and with her consent, we photographed the area, including the handrail height for reference.

A physical examination revealed redness on Rosa’s upper arm consistent with the described contact, which was also photographed with a scale for evidence. We requested building security to preserve access logs and surveillance footage from 16:45 to 17:10 in Stairwell B and adjacent corridors. An official preservation request was emailed to property management, referencing the incident number.

Witnesses were identified, including a coworker named Dev, who observed Rosa returning visibly upset, and an HR representative named Ally, who was notified at Rosa’s request. Rosa consented to Ally’s presence during the interview for support, though officers maintained an independent record.

Rosa chose to conduct the interview in English. We offered a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam, explaining options for immediate, delayed, or no exam, and provided paper bags for clothing preservation if desired. Rosa elected to delay the exam and was advised on preserving potential evidence by avoiding washing the affected area.

Digital evidence was collected, including a text message from the suspect sent at 17:01 stating, “We good?” A screenshot with time metadata was captured, and Rosa consented to a later forensic download via consent or warrant.

The suspect was not present at the scene, and no contact was attempted to preserve investigative integrity. Rosa accepted an offer to speak with a hotline advocate, who joined the call for emotional support.

Rosa described how she escaped by stepping down the stairs, firmly saying “No,” and exiting through the door on the third floor. We conducted a walkthrough of the scene with her consent, confirming that the door latch functioned normally and that lighting was adequate. Surveillance cameras were likely to have captured entry and exit points.

Rosa requested assistance in informing her supervisor. We provided her with a brief statement template that allowed her to communicate without disclosing details she was not ready to share. Safety planning options were discussed, including schedule changes, security escorts, and information on protective orders.

We clarified next steps, emphasizing that today’s account was preliminary and that a formal recorded interview could be scheduled later at her discretion. Rosa was reminded that her participation level was entirely her choice.

After a short break, Rosa recalled the suspect’s appearance: wearing a gray quarter-zip and an ID badge with a red lanyard. We requested HR to retain badge activity records and sent a preservation letter.

Throughout the interview, officers avoided leading questions and character judgments, focusing strictly on factual details and exact quotes. Rosa inquired about no-contact orders and was advised on internal HR and criminal options, receiving relevant informational forms.

The interview concluded with a review and summary of Rosa’s statement, which she confirmed and signed, acknowledging the voluntary nature of her participation. At 17:51 hours, we cleared the scene to begin follow-up canvassing of surveillance cameras. The entire incident response concluded at 18:19 hours.

On September 6, 2025, at approximately 13:11 hours, I, Officer Hwang (#2984), along with Officer Cutter (#3110), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at the City Library, specifically in Study Room 2C. The weather was overcast with a temperature of 70°F. Upon arrival, the scene was quiet, with the librarian, identified as Marta, present in the room.

At 13:11:30, the complainant, Elise, requested privacy, and with her consent, the librarian stepped out. I introduced myself and Officer Cutter, explained the purpose of our presence, and obtained Elise’s consent to record the interview. We established ground rules, emphasizing that she could stop the interview at any time and that I would ask open-ended questions.

Elise began her narrative by stating that she and the suspect were studying together when he closed the door and began touching her without consent. She clearly stated, “I said ‘No, I don’t want that.’” I acknowledged her statement and gently asked what happened next. Elise described that the suspect laughed and persisted despite her refusal. She moved his hand away and stood up.

Throughout the interview, I carefully clarified the sequence of events without interrupting, ensuring accurate documentation of her quotes and actions. Elise mentioned placing a chair angled under the door knob after the suspect left the room. We photographed the chair’s position for evidentiary purposes and then restored it to its original placement, noting that this action occurred post-incident.

Elise reported no visible injuries but expressed feelings of nausea and anxiety. We offered emergency medical services, which she declined, though she requested to speak with a victim advocate. I provided a full explanation of Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) options, which Elise chose to consider later. Written information regarding timeframes and confidentiality was given to her.

Regarding evidence, the library’s corridor cameras cover the area. I requested librarian Marta to preserve footage from 12:10 to 12:50, completing a written preservation request on my body camera. A fellow student named Jon was identified as a possible witness who may have knocked on the door around 12:40; his contact information was obtained.

Elise presented a text message from the suspect sent after the incident, stating, “Sorry if I pushed boundaries.” I photographed the message with a timestamp for evidence. The interview was conducted entirely in English, and no interpreter was required.

To assist with sensory recall, I asked if there were any sounds or phrases she wanted noted. Elise recalled the suspect saying, “Come on, it’s just us.” We discussed safety measures, and Elise accepted an escort to exit the library and arrange a rideshare.

Throughout the interaction, we maintained a trauma-informed approach, keeping a steady tone, avoiding surprise questions, and reflecting key points back to Elise for accuracy. She assisted in annotating a quick sketch of the room and door, which was photographed for documentation.

No leading questions or credibility assessments were made; all statements were recorded verbatim. We scheduled a formal follow-up interview for when Elise felt ready and provided her with the case number and a point of contact. When Elise inquired about a no-contact order, we explained the process and connected her with victim services.

We conducted a brief walkthrough with the librarian to locate all relevant cameras and noted their retention policies. Elise rested while we maintained a supportive presence until she indicated readiness to leave. At approximately 13:33, we escorted her to her rideshare, ensuring her safe departure and updated the CAD accordingly.

Officers returned to the scene to collect notes on camera angles and concluded the incident at 14:05 hours.

On September 6, 2025, at approximately 17:09 hours, I, Sergeant Kim (#1907), accompanied by Officer Alvarado (#2256), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at the Community Pool, specifically in Staff Locker Room A. The weather was hot, around 89°F. Upon arrival, we were met by the pool manager in a tiled corridor near the locker rooms.

The complainant, identified as Tara, a lifeguard at the facility, requested to speak with us privately in an office. After obtaining consent from the manager to step out, we proceeded with the interview. Tara consented to have the conversation recorded, and I explained her rights, including the option to pause or stop the recording at any time.

Tara provided a detailed narrative of the incident. She stated that after finishing her shift, she entered the staff locker room alone when a coworker followed her inside. She described unwanted touching by this individual despite her verbal objections, specifically saying, “Stop. Not okay.” She recalled pushing his hand away and stepping back to create distance. Tara emphasized these actions as the most vivid memories of the encounter.

We requested preservation of video footage from the hallway door camera covering the time frame between 16:20 and 16:50, which the manager agreed to. The locker room is designated staff-only, and we documented the entry point, interior layout, and posted signage indicating restricted access. Care was taken to avoid filming any individuals in states of undress to maintain privacy.

A physical examination of Tara revealed no visible injuries; however, she reported lingering anxiety and soreness in her wrist. With her consent, photographs were taken of any redness or marks. I explained the option for a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam, clarifying that the employer’s policies did not mandate it. Tara chose to undergo the exam later, after arranging shift coverage. She accepted the offer of an advocate for support.

We identified a potential witness, a coworker named Neil, who may have overheard Tara’s verbal objection. Contact information was collected, and a full interview will be scheduled privately. A review of digital communications revealed no relevant texts, and the suspect had left the premises early. We requested badge swipe logs to verify movements.

To ensure Tara’s safety, a plan was discussed and agreed upon involving schedule adjustments and non-overlapping shifts arranged by her supervisor. During the interview, Tara sketched a map illustrating her and the suspect’s positions during the incident, which was photographed for the record.

Throughout the process, we focused strictly on factual details—actions, words, and timing—without offering opinions on character. I informed Tara of her options regarding pursuing criminal charges, administrative action, both, or neither, emphasizing support for her informed decision-making.

Before concluding, Tara confirmed the accuracy of the summary I provided, adding that the suspect wore a red swim parka and that she had placed her bag between them as a barrier. Our canvass of the locker area was temporarily paused when another staff member entered; the body-worn camera was angled downward to respect privacy.

The manager returned, and we reiterated the importance of preserving evidence and reminded all parties about non-retaliation policies. We arranged transportation for Tara to the exam site and provided her with a rights sheet and a list of resources.

At 18:03 hours, we cleared the scene. Follow-up tasks were logged, including retrieval of CCTV footage, badge swipe logs, scheduling interviews, and monitoring the status of the medical exam.

On September 7, 2025, at approximately 07:21 hours, I, Officer Doyle (#3198), along with Officer Kravitz (#2902), responded to a sexual assault report at Office Park Lot C, Bay 19. The weather was clear with a temperature of 78°F. Upon arrival, we met the reporting party, identified as Noor, standing next to her vehicle.

After introductions, Noor expressed a preference to sit in a shaded area nearby, which we accommodated. We explained the process, including her options for breaks and the availability of advocacy services, and obtained her consent to record the interview.

Noor began her free narrative by stating that the incident occurred the previous evening after work. She explained that the suspect, with whom she had previously carpooled, drove her home. During the ride, while seated in the backseat, the suspect repeatedly touched her inappropriately despite her verbal objections. Noor recalled telling him to stop and using phrases such as “No, I don’t want this” and “Take me home.” She described the route taken, including a stop in a parking lot, which we documented.

With Noor’s permission, we inspected and photographed the backseat area of the vehicle. The photos showed seat covers and a tissue box; there were no visible signs of disturbance or damage. Noor reported a developing bruise on her thigh, which she consented to have photographed with a scale for documentation purposes. We offered emergency medical services on scene, but she declined, opting instead to visit a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) clinic later that day.

We inquired about digital evidence and learned that rideshare receipts were not applicable since the suspect was a coworker providing a carpool. However, Noor shared a text message she received from the suspect after the incident, which read, “Sorry if I crossed a line.” This message was captured and preserved.

A neighbor, who witnessed Noor arriving home visibly upset, was identified as a potential witness. Contact information was noted for follow-up. We discussed evidence preservation options with Noor, including the possibility of submitting her clothing for forensic analysis after her medical exam. She was undecided at that time.

We informed Noor about safety measures, including the option to pursue a protection order and support available through her workplace liaison. Throughout the interview, we maintained a clear, trauma-informed, and non-judgmental approach, particularly regarding her prior rides with the suspect.

We requested CCTV footage from the office parking lot for the time frame between 18:05 and 18:45 the previous evening and notified property management of the request. A scene diagram was created and photographed, detailing seating positions within the vehicle.

Noor inquired about pressing charges, and we explained the timelines involved and emphasized that reporting the incident today preserved her options for future legal action. She confirmed the accuracy of our summary.

An addendum was noted: the suspect briefly engaged the child safety lock from the driver’s controls, and Noor had to pull the door handle twice to exit the vehicle. This detail was documented.

On September 7, 2025, at approximately 18:12 hours, I, Officer Carter (#1842), accompanied by Officer Velasquez (#2079), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at 60 Orchard Co-Op, specifically Room 3B Common Area. The weather was overcast with a temperature of 71°F. Upon arrival, we made contact with the reporting party, identified as Piper, who was in the common area with her roommates nearby.

Piper requested to speak in a private room, which we promptly granted. At 18:13, after moving to a private setting, we obtained Piper’s consent to record the interview and established ground rules for the conversation. Piper began a free narrative, stating that earlier that day, while watching a movie in her room, she explicitly communicated that she did not want to engage in any sexual activity. Despite this, the suspect attempted to initiate sexual contact.

When asked to clarify her response, Piper explained that she said “No,” physically moved the suspect’s hand away, stood up, and opened the door to leave the room. The incident occurred between approximately 16:30 and 16:45. We documented her exact quotes and actions as part of the report.

With Piper’s consent, we took photographs of the room layout, focusing on the door, bed, and the path leading to the hallway, while ensuring no personal items were captured to maintain privacy. During the interview, Piper’s roommate provided a witness statement, reporting that they heard raised voices and observed the suspect leaving the area quickly. Contact information for the roommate was collected for follow-up.

We informed Piper about the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) services available to her. She chose to delay the examination but was provided with information regarding timeframes and guidance on preserving potential evidence, including clothing. Digital evidence was also collected, including messages from the suspect, one of which read, “Can we talk?”

Safety planning was discussed thoroughly. Piper agreed to stay with her roommate, keep her door locked, and call the police if the suspect returned. We also discussed options for no-contact orders. An advocate was offered and accepted; the call was conducted on speakerphone to provide emotional support.

Piper communicated in English, and no interpreter was necessary. Throughout the interview, we avoided making any comments that could affect her credibility and reflected back her statements to ensure accuracy. Follow-up tasks were logged, including reviewing building entry logs and checking campus security cameras near the lobby for additional evidence.

Piper inquired about reporting the incident to campus authorities. We explained the parallel reporting processes and emphasized that the decision was hers to make. The interview concluded at 19:06 hours with the provision of a case number, a contact card, and a list of available resources.

On September 8, 2025, at approximately 16:58 hours, I, Sergeant Salazar (#2081), along with Officer Keane (#3775), responded to a sexual assault report at the boat ramp picnic table area located at 1100 Lakeside. The weather was mild, around 73°F, and the scene was a public outdoor area near the water.

Upon arrival, we met with the reporting party, who identified herself as “Hannah.” To ensure her comfort and privacy, we offered her a quieter location to speak. She declined moving away from the area but chose to sit inside the patrol SUV with the door open. After explaining her rights and options, Hannah consented to have the conversation recorded on body-worn cameras.

Hannah provided a free narrative of the incident. She stated that she had met an acquaintance at the boat ramp the previous evening. They sat together on the dock, during which the acquaintance engaged in unwanted sexual contact despite her verbal refusals, including saying “No, stop.” I clarified the sequence of events, confirming the approach, verbal exchanges, and physical actions. Hannah reported that after the unwanted contact, she stood up and left the area, heading toward the parking lot lights.

A physical examination revealed no visible injuries, though Hannah reported soreness. We offered emergency medical services, which she declined. We then requested marina staff to provide CCTV footage from the marina and parking lot cameras covering the time frame of 20:10 to 20:45 the previous night. The staff were cooperative and agreed to preserve the footage.

Hannah shared that she had received text messages from the suspect after the incident, including one stating, “I misread.” We captured screenshots of these messages for evidence. We explained the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam, and Hannah chose to proceed with the exam. We arranged transportation to the hospital and notified a victim advocate to provide support.

We took photographs of the general area to document the scene, ensuring not to intrude on the public or compromise privacy. Lighting conditions were noted as adequate for visibility. We identified a potential witness—a fisherman who had been nearby during the incident. With permission from marina staff, we left a business card on the windshield of a vehicle likely associated with the suspect and checked the marina’s security log for additional information.

During the interview, we discussed safety planning. Hannah shared her location with a friend, and we provided information about restraining orders and other protective measures. Throughout the interview, we maintained a neutral tone, avoided leading questions, and did not minimize any prior interactions Hannah described.

At the conclusion of the interview, I read back a summary of Hannah’s account. She confirmed the details and added that the suspect had been wearing cologne, which we documented. We outlined follow-up tasks, including coordinating with detectives for a formal interview and securing the requested camera footage.

The interview and on-scene investigation concluded at approximately 17:52 hours.

On September 8, 2025, at approximately 22:09 hours, I, Officer Ebner (#2339), accompanied by Officer Fox (#2577), responded to a sexual assault report at the 700 Grand Hotel, Room 1221 Sitting Area. The weather was cloudy with a temperature of 69°F. Upon arrival, hotel security escorted us directly to the room where the complainant, identified as Mae, was present with a friend.

At 22:10, I introduced myself and explained the purpose of our visit. Mae consented to have the interaction recorded on body-worn cameras. She requested that her friend remain in the room but stay quiet during the interview, which we respected. Mae then provided a free narrative of the incident. She described an initial consensual kissing encounter with the suspect, followed by non-consensual touching. Mae stated that she repeatedly said “No” during the incident. According to her account, the suspect ceased his actions only after she stood up and pointed toward the door.

To clarify the sequence of events without implying blame, I asked Mae what the suspect’s response was when she said “No.” She replied that he said, “Come on,” and attempted to continue before ultimately stopping. Throughout the interview, I maintained a neutral and supportive tone, ensuring Mae felt in control of the conversation.

At 22:12, I requested relevant evidence from hotel security, including hallway surveillance footage covering the time frame from 21:00 to 22:15 and keycard access logs for Room 1221. A consent letter for recording was documented and signed by Mae. I then proceeded to document the scene by taking wide, mid-range, and close-up photographs of the seating area, door, and lighting conditions. I refrained from making any subjective comments about the state of the room to preserve neutrality.

At 22:14, I explained the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination to Mae. She was undecided at the time, so I provided her with informational packets and paper bags to preserve any clothing she might choose to submit for evidence later.

During the digital evidence collection phase at 22:15, I captured messages from the suspect on Mae’s phone, including a text that read, “Can we talk?” At 22:16, we spoke with a neighbor in Room 1223 who reported hearing voices during the relevant time period. Security personnel agreed to follow up with the neighbor for additional information, and we collected preliminary witness details.

For Mae’s safety, arrangements were made for her to stay with her friend in the hotel for the night. The hotel offered a room change, and we ensured Mae had a key to her room along with instructions on how to secure the door lock properly.

At 22:17, Officer Fox and I summarized the information gathered, carefully avoiding leading questions and emphasizing Mae’s autonomy and choices throughout the process. We informed her of the next steps and assured her of continued support.

By 23:04, all on-scene activities were concluded. Follow-up tasks were assigned, including coordination with detectives and monitoring evidence preservation deadlines. The case remains open pending further investigation.

On September 9, 2025, at approximately 16:06 hours, I, Officer Ortega (#2688), along with Officer Wynn (#3011), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at City Beach, specifically near Dune Path 3 Bench. The weather was breezy with a temperature of 76°F. Upon arrival, we met the reporting party, who identified herself as “Aria,” seated on the bench. Due to wind noise interfering with our body-worn camera audio, I shielded the microphone and offered to relocate to a quieter area. Aria preferred to proceed to the nearby beach office, which was quieter and more private.

At 16:07, after explaining the options available to her and obtaining her consent to record the interview, Aria began a free narrative of the incident. She described an encounter earlier that day involving a male individual. According to her account, the interaction began with consensual kissing but escalated to non-consensual touching. Aria stated that she verbally said “Stop” and physically moved away from the individual, who then followed her briefly. I carefully documented her exact words and the timeline she provided, ensuring to note the specific language used by both parties to maintain accuracy and neutrality.

At 16:09, I requested that the lifeguard tower camera footage be reviewed, as it might have captured the corridor near the incident location. This request was logged, and the beach office staff were cooperative in facilitating access to any potential evidence. I also took photographs of the general area surrounding the bench and dune path. However, due to the time elapsed since the incident and the public nature of the location, no footprints or physical traces were collected. This limitation was explicitly noted in the report.

At 16:10, I reviewed the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) options with Aria, who elected to undergo a forensic medical examination. Additionally, a possible witness—a jogger who may have passed by the area during the incident—was mentioned. A card with contact information was left at the kiosk, and the beach office agreed to distribute information about the department’s anonymous social media tip line to encourage any witnesses to come forward.

At 16:11, I confirmed that Aria had a safe ride arranged and provided her with a resource sheet containing support services, the case number (CAD# 25-240149), and instructions for follow-up. Throughout the interview, I maintained a trauma-informed approach, pacing the conversation carefully without leading questions, and documented the narrative in a neutral and factual manner.

We began by clarifying the independent criminal process to Maya, ensuring she understood her rights and the procedures involved. At 10:20:11, Maya provided consent to record the interview, acknowledging her right to pause or stop the recording at any time.

Maya gave a free narrative account of the incident. She described an unwanted touching that occurred in the phone room by a male coworker. She stated that she explicitly said, “No, this is not okay,” but the individual persisted briefly before she exited the room. We took care to clarify the sequence of events, exact quotes, and physical positions without making any character judgments or assumptions.

At 10:22:19, we documented evidence related to the incident, including badge logs and security camera footage from the corridor outside the phone room. A preservation request was immediately sent to ensure these materials were secured.

We informed Maya about the option to undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination. She declined the exam but accepted an information packet detailing available medical and counseling resources.

At 10:23:28, we collected digital evidence in the form of an email from the suspect, which contained the message: “Apologies if I made you uncomfortable.” This email was saved, photographed, and the header information preserved. The department’s IT unit was instructed to archive the email with a retention hold to prevent deletion.

We identified a potential witness, a coworker who reported hearing the door close quickly during the time of the incident. Contact information for this witness was obtained for possible follow-up.

Regarding Maya’s safety and workplace accommodations, HR arranged a schedule change to minimize contact with the suspect. We also provided Maya with information about protection orders should she choose to pursue one.

At 10:26:07, we read back a summary of the interview and evidence collected to Maya, who confirmed the accuracy of the report. The entire interview and evidence collection process concluded at 11:12:33.

On September 10, 2025, at approximately 00:22 hours, I, Sgt. Patel (#1876), along with P.O. Ortega (#2688), responded to a sexual assault report at 44 Easton Bar, specifically the Patio Nook area. The weather was clear with a temperature of 72°F. Upon arrival, we were guided by bar staff to a quieter corner of the patio where the reporting party, identified as “Skye,” a woman in her mid-20s, was seated with a friend named “Jules.”

After introductions and obtaining Skye’s consent to record the interview, we offered her options for the interview location: inside the bar’s office, in a patrol vehicle, or remaining on the patio. Skye chose to proceed inside the staff office. Once seated, we ensured she was comfortable, offering water and explaining she could pause or stop the interview at any time.

Skye provided a free narrative account of the incident. She stated that she met a man near the patio heaters, where they shared a brief kiss. She clearly communicated that she did not want to proceed further, saying “No, stop.” Despite this, the man placed his hand under her skirt. Skye repeatedly told him to stop, but he continued to touch her. She described moving his hand away and stepping to the left, after which he said “Relax” and “You’re fine,” but persisted. Skye then left the patio area and found Jules inside the bar.

We documented the suspect’s physical description as approximately 5 feet 10 inches tall, with a beard, wearing a blue cap bearing a brewery logo, a gray hoodie, and dark jeans. Skye reported no visible injuries but mentioned soreness in her thigh, along with feelings of anxiety and nausea. We offered EMS assistance, which she declined.

We informed Skye about the availability of a Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SAFE/SANE), which can be done at no cost and with or without filing a police report. After discussing timing and support options, Skye elected to undergo the exam that evening. We contacted the on-call SANE nurse and coordinated transport.

With the bar manager’s consent, I photographed the patio area, focusing on heater #2, the bench, and lighting conditions to document the scene. The manager confirmed that CCTV cameras covered the patio and entrance. We requested preservation of footage from 23:20 to 00:15, and the manager signed consent forms to retain and copy the recordings.

We spoke briefly with Jules, who reported that Skye entered the bar upset around 23:56, stating “He wouldn’t stop.” Jules provided contact information for a more detailed statement later. Another patron, “Mack,” may have witnessed the interaction near the heaters; we left a business card via the manager for follow-up.

Skye identified the suspect as “Evan” and showed us an Instagram profile she believed matched him. We photographed the screen displaying the handle and time. Skye consented to a possible forensic download of messages if any occur, though she preferred to delay signing formal consent.

Throughout the interview, we maintained a trauma-informed approach, slowing the pace when Skye became tearful and validating her feelings. She recalled sensory details such as the suspect’s citrus cologne and a woven bracelet with blue threads on his wrist. When asked what helped her end the interaction, she stated that stepping away and saying “I’m going inside” allowed her to leave.

We discussed safety planning; Jules agreed to accompany Skye to the clinic and then home. We reviewed rideshare safety, potential no-contact orders if the suspect is identified, and the bar’s trespass policy. Skye was provided with her case number, a victim rights sheet, and an advocacy hotline was contacted with her permission. An advocate was arranged to meet her at the clinic.

No suspect was present on scene. We instructed bar staff to notify us if a person matching the description returned. No detentions were made due to lack of lawful basis.

We summarized the report back to Skye, confirming details including the location near heater #2, the initial consensual kiss, subsequent non-consensual touching despite verbal refusals, suspect quotes, and her actions to leave. Skye added that the suspect wore a thin silver ring on his right index finger.

We prepared paper bags and labels for potential evidence collection, explaining options for anonymous or named kits. Environmental notes included moderate patio lighting and heater fan noise, which may affect audio quality on CCTV.

We coordinated transport for Skye to the SANE facility, with the bar providing a security escort to the alley for privacy. Follow-up tasks were logged, including obtaining CCTV copies, identifying the suspect via social media and bar tabs between 22:30 and 00:10, and re-contacting witness “Mack.”

At approximately 01:14 hours, we cleared the scene after Skye departed with the advocate. Throughout the incident, we maintained a professional and neutral demeanor, avoiding leading questions or commentary on credibility.

On September 10, 2025, at approximately 12:11 hours, I, Officer Li (#2631), accompanied by Officer Gomez (#2740), responded to a sexual assault report at 2130 Briarwood Lane, Apartment 1D. The weather was overcast with a temperature of 67°F. Upon arrival, the resident, identified as Iris, opened the door and invited us inside to speak at the kitchen table.

After obtaining her consent to record the conversation, I explained that she could pause the recording at any time and that we would ask open-ended questions to allow her to share her account freely. Iris began by describing the events of the previous evening. She stated that she and the suspect had watched a television show together and cuddled on the living room couch. She clearly communicated that she did not want to proceed further, but the suspect continued to touch her chest and hips despite her verbal refusals. Iris recalled saying “No,” “Not okay,” and “Stop,” to which the suspect responded, “Come on, you’re into it.”

I asked Iris to provide a timeline of the incident. She reported that the suspect arrived around 20:00 hours, the show ended at 21:10, and the unwanted contact occurred between 21:15 and 21:25. She then asked him to leave, and he departed at approximately 21:30.

With Iris’s permission, Officer Gomez documented the scene by photographing the living room couch, a throw blanket, the path to the front door, and the lighting conditions. No inferences were made during this process. Iris was still wearing the same leggings from the previous night. We informed her that clothing collection was optional and could be done free of charge through a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam. She elected to undergo the exam later that day and was provided with paper bags should she change clothes before transport.

A medical assessment revealed no visible injuries, though Iris reported soreness. Emergency Medical Services were offered but declined; she planned to discuss pain management with the SANE nurse. During our investigation, we identified a potential witness, a neighbor named Liam, who reported hearing muffled voices around 21:20. We collected his contact information for a follow-up interview.

After leaving the residence, the suspect sent a text message to Iris stating, “Sorry if I pushed too far.” We photographed the message screen with timestamps and discussed consent for downloading the device later, which Iris agreed to. Regarding safety concerns, Iris confirmed that the suspect did not have a key to her apartment. We advised her on options such as changing locks and obtaining protective orders.

I asked Iris what helped her end the interaction, and she explained that she stood up, pointed to the door, and firmly told the suspect, “I need you to go.” She also recalled sensory details, noting the suspect wore an aftershave and a canvas jacket with a torn cuff.

We inquired about available CCTV footage; the property manager agreed to preserve exterior entry camera footage from 20:45 to 21:45. An email request for this footage was recorded on camera. We connected Iris with a local advocacy service, and an advocate joined the call to explain exam options and provide support.

I summarized the information back to Iris, who confirmed the details and added that the suspect had parked a black Honda Civic near spot 12, with a partial license plate reading “8DL—.” We planned follow-up tasks including canvassing for the vehicle, reviewing municipal camera footage, and scheduling a formal interview when Iris felt ready.

On September 11, 2025, at approximately 16:05 hours, I, Officer Hwang (#2984), along with Officer Cutter (#3110), responded to a sexual assault report at the Boardwalk Underpass — North Ramp area. The weather was cloudy with a temperature of 65°F. Upon arrival, we met with the reporting party, who identified herself as “Nova,” under the shaded section of the underpass. Due to wind noise and to ensure privacy, we offered to relocate the interview to a nearby lifeguard office, which Nova preferred.

After obtaining her consent to record the interview, Nova provided a free narrative of the incident. She stated that she and the suspect had walked from the beach to the underpass area. During this time, the suspect began touching her inappropriately under the bridge. Nova told him to stop and moved away, but the suspect attempted to touch her again. When asked to describe the sequence of events from leaving the beach to arriving at the lifeguard office, Nova estimated the timeframe between 15:30 and 15:50. She recalled the suspect saying, “Why are you acting shy?” to which she responded “No” twice. She then stepped into sunlight near the ramp, at which point the suspect ceased following her.

We documented the scene by photographing the ramp, the shaded areas, and the adjacent path. Ambient sounds such as tide noise and lighting conditions at approximately 16:10 were noted to provide context. There were no claims of disturbance beyond the reported assault. We identified a city pole camera on the boardwalk and requested preservation of footage from 15:15 to 16:00 through dispatch.

Nova reported no visible injuries but mentioned feeling stressed and having a scrape from an earlier incident unrelated to the assault. Emergency Medical Services were offered but declined. We explained the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination in detail. Nova chose to consider this later and was provided with a written guide outlining timelines and the availability of a “blind kit” for evidence collection.

We attempted to locate witnesses and learned that a surfer named “Leo” might have been in the vicinity. We left a business card at the nearby surf shop and included a tipline QR code in the report for potential leads. Nova described the suspect as wearing a red baseball cap, a white t-shirt with “SEASIDE” printed on it, and carrying a skateboard. She also added that the suspect had a wrist tattoo depicting waves.

Regarding digital evidence, Nova reported no immediate messages from the suspect and had blocked his number. We informed her that this action would not affect the investigation or the report. Safety planning was discussed; Nova confirmed she had a ride home arranged. We also discussed the possibility of returning any property if necessary and provided her with a list of local resources for support.

At 16:14, we read back a summary of the report to Nova, who confirmed its accuracy and added the detail about the wrist tattoo. Follow-up actions were planned, including retrieval of CCTV footage, canvassing the surf shop for witnesses, and scheduling a formal interview with Nova.

On September 11, 2025, at approximately 10:31 hours, I, Sergeant Kim (#1907), along with Officer Alvarado (#2256), responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the Community Garden Shed. The weather was hot, around 88°F. Upon arrival, we were greeted outside the shed by a community volunteer who identified herself as “Sage.”

After obtaining Sage’s consent to record the interview, we proceeded to a shaded picnic table nearby, as per her preference, to ensure her comfort during the statement. Sage began by explaining that she had been sorting tools inside the shed with an individual when he placed his hand on her waist and attempted to make further physical contact. She immediately told him to stop, stating, “Stop. Not okay.”

To clarify the sequence of events and spatial details, Sage pointed to a bench inside the shed where the incident occurred and then stepped back toward the doorway to demonstrate the positions of both parties. We documented the scene thoroughly, taking photographs of the bench, the tool wall, and the narrow aisle between them. We also measured the aisle width to better understand the proximity and possible movement constraints within the space. All descriptions were kept neutral and factual.

Sage recounted that the suspect said, “No one’s around,” while she firmly responded, “Stop, I don’t want this.” She reported no visible injuries but stated that she felt shaken by the encounter. Emergency Medical Services were offered but declined at that time. We explained the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination, and Sage chose to proceed with it. We coordinated transport to a nearby clinic and, with her permission, contacted an advocate to provide support.

The garden coordinator, who was nearby, reported hearing raised voices shortly after the incident. We obtained their contact information for follow-up. We also reviewed the shed’s lock sign-in sheet and photographed it, requesting preservation of records between 09:45 and 10:45 to assist with the investigation.

For safety planning, the coordinator agreed to adjust volunteer schedules to prevent overlapping shifts that might place Sage and the suspect together again. We discussed the possibility of trespass orders should the suspect return to the garden.

During the interview, sensory details were noted: the smell of soil and cedar was present in the shed, and the suspect was described as wearing green work gloves and a faded cap. No digital evidence was exchanged, and Sage confirmed that she and the suspect did not share contact information.

We read back a summary of the statement to Sage, who confirmed its accuracy and added that the suspect briefly blocked the aisle before she stepped around him. This detail was documented without inference.

Finally, we collected a copy of the sign-in sheet, requested CCTV footage from the park entrance, and scheduled a formal follow-up interview. Our time on scene concluded at 11:29 hours.

On September 12, 2025, at approximately 17:59 hours, I, Officer Doyle (#3198), along with Officer Kravitz (#2902), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at the gazebo located within 500 City Gardens. The weather was sunny with a temperature of 82°F. Upon arrival, we met with the reporting party, identified as “Remi,” who was seated near a group of adolescents on the grass. To ensure privacy and a more comfortable environment for the interview, we suggested moving to the nearby park office, to which Remi agreed.

At 18:00, after obtaining Remi’s consent to record the interview, I prompted for a free narrative. Remi stated that they had been sitting on the grass talking with the suspect when he began touching them without consent. Remi clearly recalled saying, “No, stop,” but the suspect responded by laughing. Through non-leading questions, I established a timeline of events occurring between approximately 17:10 and 17:25. Remi described standing up, stepping away from the suspect, and walking toward the gazebo area.

Remi recounted that the suspect dismissed their refusal by saying, “Don’t be dramatic,” while Remi reiterated, “I said no.” I documented the scene by taking photographs of the lawn area where the initial interaction occurred, the path leading to the gazebo, and a nearby bench. Lighting conditions were noted as adequate, and the presence of bystanders was minimal but included a group of teenagers nearby.

Remi reported soreness in their knee, attributed to getting up quickly during the incident. I photographed the injury with a scale for documentation purposes and offered emergency medical services, which Remi declined. I then informed Remi about Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) options; Remi opted for a delayed examination and was provided with informational materials and paper bags for evidence preservation.

We identified potential witnesses, including a group of teens who may have observed the interaction. Contact information was obtained for one individual named “Ava,” who had approached Remi shortly after the incident. For safety planning, Remi indicated plans to leave the park with a roommate. We provided a resource list and the case number for future reference.

During the interview, Remi disclosed that the suspect had sent a direct message on a social media platform stating, “You’re overreacting.” A screenshot of this message, including the timestamp and user handle, was captured for evidence. Additionally, I requested preservation of CCTV footage from the park entrance camera covering the timeframe of 16:45 to 17:45 to assist with the investigation.

Before concluding the interview at 18:55, I reviewed the summary of events with Remi, who confirmed the accuracy of the account. Remi added that the suspect was wearing a black beanie and had a bicycle chained nearby, details which may assist in identifying the individual.

On September 12, 2025, at approximately 07:28 hours, I, Officer Ebner (#2339), along with Officer Fox (#2577), responded to a sexual assault report at Office Park Lot C, Bay 42. The weather was clear with a temperature of 79°F. Upon arrival, we met with the reporting party, identified as Priya, near her sedan.

After obtaining Priya’s consent to record the interview, she chose to remain in the lobby area rather than move to the conference room. Priya provided a free narrative of the incident, stating that after work the previous day, the suspect had offered her a ride. While seated in the backseat of the suspect’s vehicle, he touched her leg and hip without consent. Priya stated she told him “No, stop,” and although he continued briefly, he eventually ceased the contact.

We clarified the route taken and parking details. Priya explained that the suspect pulled into Bay 42 at approximately 18:22 and she exited the vehicle at 18:25. She recalled the suspect saying, “Come on, it’s fine,” to which she responded firmly, “No. Take your hand off me.”

With Priya’s permission, we documented the vehicle’s interior by taking photographs of the backseat area. The condition of the vehicle was neutral, and Priya did not report any issues regarding cleanliness or disorder.

During the physical examination, Priya indicated a bruise was forming on her leg. We photographed the bruise with a scale for reference. Emergency Medical Services were offered on scene, but Priya declined immediate treatment, opting instead to pursue a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination at a later time.

Digital evidence was collected, including a text message from the suspect sent at 19:02 the previous evening, which read, “We good?” This message was captured and logged as potential evidence.

We identified a coworker witness who observed Priya exiting the suspect’s vehicle quickly. The witness’s contact information was recorded for follow-up. Additionally, we requested preservation of CCTV footage from the lot cameras covering the time frame of 18:10 to 18:40 to assist in corroborating Priya’s account.

Safety planning was discussed with Priya, including providing contact information for the company’s Human Resources liaison and resources for protective orders. Priya was given the case number for reference.

Before concluding the interview at 08:24, I read back a summary of the report to Priya, who confirmed the accuracy of the details and added that the suspect’s vehicle was a blue SUV equipped with a roof rack.

The incident was documented thoroughly, and all evidence and witness information were secured for further investigation. Priya was advised on next steps and support services available to her.

On September 13, 2025, at approximately 21:47 hours, I, Officer Carter (#1842), along with Officer Velasquez (#2079), responded to a call classified as a Sexual Assault Report at 75 Willow Glen, Unit 3D. The weather was overcast with a temperature of 69°F. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the reporting party, identified as Keira, who invited us into the living room. A roommate was present at the scene, but at Keira’s request, the roommate remained in the living room while we conducted the interview in a more private setting. We confirmed her preference to ensure her comfort and safety.

After obtaining Keira’s consent to record the interview and explaining trauma-informed ground rules to support her well-being, Keira provided a free narrative of the incident. She stated that she had invited the suspect over to talk and watch a show. Initially, they kissed, but the situation escalated when the suspect attempted to place his hand inside her pants. Keira clearly stated that she said “No, I don’t want this,” and pushed his hand away twice. She then moved toward the door, at which point the suspect left the premises at approximately 20:15.

We proceeded to document the scene with Keira’s consent, taking photographs of the bedroom doorway, bed, and the path leading to the living room. Care was taken to maintain privacy by avoiding any personal documents or sensitive information in the images. A medical assessment was conducted, revealing no visible injuries; however, Keira reported experiencing anxiety and shaking. Emergency Medical Services were offered but declined by Keira.

We informed Keira about Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) options, and she opted for a delayed examination. She was provided with informational materials and paper evidence bags for potential future use. During the interview, we also collected digital evidence, including a screenshot of a text message from the suspect asking, “Did I go too far?” The message headers were documented for investigative purposes.

The roommate, who was present earlier, confirmed overhearing Keira say “No” during the incident and agreed to provide a formal statement at a later time. We conducted a safety planning session with Keira, checking the locks on the residence and verifying emergency contacts programmed into her phone. We provided her with a list of resources, including counseling and victim support services, along with the case number for reference.

Before concluding the interview, I read back a summary of the information gathered to ensure accuracy. Keira confirmed the details and added that the suspect was wearing a gray hoodie with paint stains at the time of the incident. The entire interaction concluded at 22:41 hours.

On September 13, 2025, at approximately 21:12 hours, I, Officer Hwang (#2984), along with Officer Cutter (#3110), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at 88 Lakeview Towers, specifically on the rooftop patio. The weather was cloudy with a temperature of 66°F. Upon arrival, building security escorted us to a quieter corner of the rooftop where the incident reportedly occurred.

At 21:12:22, a female identified as Monroe requested to speak privately in the stairwell landing. After obtaining her consent to record the conversation, Monroe provided a detailed account of the events. She stated that she and the suspect were seated on a couch, during which she clearly communicated that she did not consent to any sexual activity. Despite her refusal, the suspect placed his hand up her shirt. Monroe told him to stop, but he attempted the same action again. During the interview, Monroe described the suspect’s words, including him saying, “Don’t be stiff,” which suggested he was attempting to minimize her resistance.

I documented the scene by photographing the couch area and the access door to the rooftop. The lighting was moderate, and there was noticeable background noise from the crowd, which may have contributed to the difficulty in hearing or intervening during the incident.

Monroe did not have any visible injuries but reported feeling discomfort. We offered emergency medical services, which she declined. I explained the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam, and Monroe elected to undergo the exam that evening. An advocate was contacted and arranged to meet her at the clinic to provide support.

A witness named Rae, a friend of Monroe, was identified and reported seeing Monroe leave the rooftop visibly upset. Rae’s contact information was obtained for follow-up. Additionally, digital evidence was collected: a message sent by the suspect via Discord at 21:05 read, “I thought we were vibing.” A screenshot of this message was captured and logged as part of the investigation.

We discussed safety planning with Monroe, including the building’s offer of an escort service. We also explained her options regarding no-contact orders and provided her with the case number for reference. Monroe confirmed the summary of her statement and added that the suspect was wearing a denim jacket with a band patch at the time of the incident.

Our time on scene concluded at 22:08 hours. All evidence and statements were secured for further investigation. Monroe was advised on next steps and resources available to her.

On April 6, 2025, at approximately 02:06 hours, I, P.O. Patel (#5123), along with secondary officer P.O. Nguyen (#4419), responded to a reported sexual assault at the rear parking lot of 1190 N. Cedar Ave., City of Foxridge. Weather conditions were noted as light rain with a temperature of 47°F. Our arrival time on scene was 02:06:51, and we remained until 03:03:12.

Upon arrival, we observed a gray four-door sedan parked in the lot with the rear passenger door slightly ajar. A female adult, later identified as Ari [last name withheld], was seated on the curb near the vehicle, wrapped in a blanket provided by her friend, Kira [last name withheld], who stood nearby. I introduced myself and Nguyen, informed Ari that we were recording on our body cameras, and obtained her consent to proceed with questioning.

Ari appeared alert, oriented, and breathing steadily. She reported soreness in her inner thighs but showed no visible external injuries on her face or forearms. Ari stated that a coworker named Luis, a Hispanic male in his mid-30s, approximately 5’10” with a medium build, wearing a navy jacket, jeans, and a black cap, had placed her in the backseat of the vehicle against her will. She recounted telling him “stop” and “no” multiple times and attempting to push him away. Luis was last seen leaving the lot in a dark SUV around 01:55 hours.

Kira confirmed she received a distressing phone call from Ari at 01:58, during which Ari was crying and said, “He won’t get out of the car,” before the call dropped. Kira then called 911 at 02:01. Dispatch verified the call time as 02:01:12.

With Ari’s consent, we visually documented the interior of the gray sedan. Observations included a torn fabric seam approximately four inches long on the back seat, tissue on the floorboard, and a condom wrapper near the rear passenger footwell. The vehicle’s license plate was partially obscured by mud, and a temporary paper permit was visible inside the rear window. No items were disturbed or collected at the scene due to weather conditions and pending further forensic examination.

Ari described the sequence of events leading to the incident: they left a bar around 01:35, Luis offered to walk her to her car, but upon arrival, he opened the back door and nudged her inside despite her protests. She stated, “I told him ‘I don’t want this’ when he pushed me down.” Ari was wearing black leggings and a gray hoodie and reported she had not showered since the incident.

I canvassed the area and spoke with the night attendant at a nearby laundromat, who agreed to contact the manager to request CCTV footage covering 01:30 to 02:10 hours. The camera was positioned to monitor a shared alley adjacent to the parking lot.

EMS arrived on scene at approximately 02:11 hours. The lead paramedic, Renee, explained medical and forensic options to Ari, who consented to a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam at Foxridge General Hospital. Ari also agreed to have the sexual assault kit released to law enforcement post-exam. Officer Nguyen provided Ari with a Victim Options pamphlet and explained the evidence collection window and clothing preservation guidelines.

We confirmed the vehicle’s temporary permit was tied to dealership inventory and not registered to Ari. Ari provided text message evidence from Luis, including a message stating, “I can walk you,” timestamped at 01:31, which was documented with her consent.

Ari and Kira were transported to the hospital by EMS at 02:13 hours. Officers remained outside the exam room during the SANE exam. At 02:46, we received the sealed Sexual Assault Kit (#FGH-25-0406-311) and clothing bags containing Ari’s leggings, underwear, and hoodie. Officer Nguyen took custody of the evidence, which was logged into the CAD and evidence module. The Evidence Unit was notified with an estimated arrival time of 03:05.

An advocate arrived at 02:58 hours, and Ari spoke with them before officers cleared the hospital at 03:03 hours.

This report summarizes the initial investigation, victim statements, evidence documentation, and chain of custody procedures related to this sexual assault case. Further follow-up will include review of CCTV footage and forensic analysis of collected evidence.

On April 9, 2025, at approximately 19:36 hours, I, Sgt. R. Salazar (#2081), along with P.O. Keane (#3775), responded to a sexual assault report at 601 E. Brookside, Unit 12. The weather was overcast with a temperature of 56°F. Upon arrival, we approached the third-floor landing and knocked on the door of Unit 12. A female voice invited us in.

Upon entry, with the victim’s consent, I observed the living room to be neat and the bedroom door open. The victim identified herself as Elena [last name withheld], and I recorded her date of birth and phone number. Elena was seated at the dining table with a blanket draped around her shoulders. She showed no visible external injuries on her face or forearms but reported soreness in her hips and lower back.

Elena stated that the suspect was “Tyler, my roommate’s friend,” who had been at the apartment earlier that day. She described the incident as occurring between 2:00 and 2:20 p.m. She recounted waking up to find Tyler on top of her, despite her saying “No, stop.” She further described pushing him away and that he covered her mouth with his hand for a few seconds. Elena emphasized that she did not consent to the encounter and said “Stop” three times during the incident.

I requested EMS and a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) for evaluation, to which Elena consented. Marissa, Elena’s roommate, was present and provided contact information. Marissa stated that Tyler left the apartment around 14:30. With Elena’s consent, I inspected the bedroom, noting a queen bed with the duvet pulled halfway off, a rumpled fitted sheet, and a pillow on the floor next to the east side nightstand. In the bathroom, I observed cotton swabs and tissues with apparent blood on the sink. Elena consented to photographs of these items, which I took, but collection was deferred to SANE guidance. I advised Elena to avoid touching or cleaning anything further, and she agreed.

P.O. Keane documented Elena’s clothing, which consisted of a T-shirt and sweatpants. Elena reported changing her shirt after the incident and identified the original shirt in the laundry basket. She confirmed she had not showered since the incident.

I canvassed the hallway and spoke with neighbor Daria in Unit 11, who reported hearing a muffled voice around 14:10 but could not discern any words. Daria provided her contact number. Marissa described Tyler as a white male, 23 years old, approximately 5’11” with a medium build, brown hair, and a small triangle tattoo on his wrist. She offered to provide his Instagram profile and phone number.

I documented the timeline: the incident occurred between 14:00 and 14:20, Tyler left at 14:30, and Elena called 911 at 18:59, as confirmed by dispatch. EMS arrived shortly after, and a victim advocate was requested. I contacted building management regarding hallway cameras; the manager stated cameras were only in the lobby. I requested lobby footage for the periods 13:30–15:00 and 18:30–19:30.

Elena consented to the release of the forensic kit to law enforcement. We provided her with a Victim Rights pamphlet and instructions on evidence preservation. EMS transported Elena and Marissa to Memorial Medical Center for the SANE examination. At 20:05, we arrived at the hospital and waited outside the exam room.

At 20:18, we received evidence including Sexual Assault Kit #MMC-25-0409-142, Clothing Bag A containing sweatpants, and Clothing Bag B containing the original shirt retrieved from the laundry in a sealed bag via EMS. Officer Keane took custody of the evidence at 20:18:33. I emailed the Detective Unit with suspect identifiers and the social media link provided by Marissa. The lobby footage preservation request was emailed to building management at 20:23. We cleared the hospital at 20:28.

This concludes my report on the sexual assault investigation at 601 E. Brookside, Unit 12. All procedures were followed in accordance with department protocol.

On April 12, 2025, at approximately 23:09 hours, I, Police Officer Martinez (#4217), along with Officer Chin (#3364), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at 410 S. Pine St., Unit 7. The weather was clear with a temperature of 61°F. Upon arrival, we proceeded to the third-floor exterior corridor and knocked on the door marked “7.” A female voice responded, “It’s open,” and we entered with consent.

Inside, we found the victim, who identified herself as Nadia [last name withheld], seated on the floor near a coffee table, wrapped in a hoodie. She provided her date of birth and phone number for the report. Nadia stated that the incident occurred around 10:40 p.m. earlier that evening in her bedroom. She reported that a co-worker named Sean, from the marketing team, was the suspect. She described the event, saying, “I told him no and he kept going,” and later, “I did not consent.”

Upon observation, I noted redness on Nadia’s inner right wrist, approximately one centimeter in size, which she consented to have photographed. No other visible injuries were noted on her face or hands. I offered emergency medical services, which she accepted. Officer Chin immediately radioed for EMS and a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) to be dispatched.

With Nadia’s consent, we conducted a scene assessment. The bedroom door was open; the bed sheet was rumpled, and a lamp was knocked over but the bulb remained intact. Nadia recounted that Sean had come over to drop off her laptop charger and that they had been drinking wine in the kitchen. She said Sean attempted to kiss her, which she declined. He then followed her to the bedroom, pushed her onto the bed, and despite her saying “Stop” and trying to get up, he persisted.

A neighbor from Unit 9, identified as Tina, reported hearing a loud thud around 22:45 but did not see anyone leave the apartment. I provided Nadia with evidence preservation guidance, and she confirmed she had not showered since the incident. Her clothing—a black dress and cardigan—was documented, and she stated she had not changed. We did not collect any clothing at the scene pending the SANE examination.

I requested building lobby surveillance footage from 21:30 to 23:30 via an emailed preservation notice. Nadia showed me text messages from Sean, including one at 21:58 stating, “I’ll swing by with the charger,” which I captured via screenshot. Nadia also relayed that Sean said, “Don’t make this a thing,” when she told him to stop. Officer Chin documented these statements verbatim.

EMS arrived at 23:12, and an advocate was requested. Nadia consented to release the sexual assault kit to law enforcement after her medical exam. I issued a case card to Nadia, explaining the investigative process and her rights. EMS transported her to Foxridge General Hospital’s Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) unit.

At 23:36, I received the sexual assault kit (FGH-25-0412-224) along with two clothing bags containing the dress and cardigan, with swabs collected by the SANE nurse. I logged the chain of custody at 23:36:35. Confirmation of the lobby footage request was received under management system ticket #PM-88214.

At 23:58, Officer Chin and I cleared the hospital, concluding our involvement in this incident.

On April 14, 2025, at approximately 16:43 hours, I, Police Officer Doyle (#3198), along with Officer Kravitz (#2902), responded to a report of a sexual assault at the Campus Quad near the Library Steps. The weather was windy with a temperature of 52°F. Upon arrival, we located the victim, identified as Jada [last name withheld], seated on a bench accompanied by her friend Kellie.

After informing Jada that we were recording, she consented to speak with us. Jada reported that a classmate assaulted her in her dorm room the previous night between 01:30 and 01:50. She stated that she repeatedly told the suspect “No, stop,” and that he covered her mouth briefly during the incident. Upon visual inspection, I observed a small linear redness approximately 0.5 cm in length on her left cheek near the hairline, which I photographed with her consent.

We requested Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and Jada consented to undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination. With her permission, we proceeded to Dorm A, Room 214, to document the scene. Upon entering the room, I noted rumpled bed linens and a tipped desk chair, but no visible damage to property.

Jada provided a detailed account of the events leading to the assault. She explained that she and the suspect, a classmate named Marcus from her chemistry class, had been studying in the lounge. Marcus walked her back to her dorm and asked to come inside. She allowed him in briefly but declined further advances. She described that he kissed her, which she resisted by pulling away and stating she did not want to engage. Inside the room, Marcus pushed her onto the bed despite her verbal refusals to stop.

Jada described the suspect as a tall male, approximately 6’1”, wearing a black hoodie and gray joggers. The dorm Resident Assistant, Devon, reported seeing a tall male exit the hallway near Room 214 at approximately 01:55 but could not identify him.

I contacted campus security to request video footage from hallway cameras covering the time frame of 01:00 to 02:30. Jada confirmed she had not showered since the incident but had changed her T-shirt at 09:00 that morning. The original T-shirt was located in her hamper; collection of this item was deferred to the SANE team.

Throughout the interview, I recorded Jada’s direct statements, including “I said ‘No, stop,’” “I tried to push him away,” and “I did not consent.” I also arranged for a campus advocacy center representative to assist Jada.

EMS transported Jada to University Hospital’s Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) unit at 16:47. At 17:12, I received the Sexual Assault Kit (#UH-25-0414-302) along with two clothing bags containing her shorts and the original T-shirt, sealed by the SANE nurse. Officer Kravitz took custody of the evidence at 17:13.

I promptly emailed the campus police investigations unit with the suspect’s description and requested the relevant camera footage. An advocate was present with Jada during the hospital examination. At 18:01, Officer Kravitz and I cleared the hospital, concluding our response.

All evidence and statements have been documented and secured for further investigation.

On April 16, 2025, at approximately 21:12 hours, I, Police Officer Gomez (#2740), along with Officer Li (#2631), responded to a report of a sexual assault at the Level 2 parking structure, Bay D-12. The weather was clear with a temperature of 48°F. Upon arrival, we located the victim, identified as Miriam [last name withheld], standing near a silver hatchback vehicle, accompanied by her friend, Noor.

I informed Miriam that we were recording and asked for her consent to speak, which she granted. Miriam reported that she had been assaulted in the back seat of a vehicle approximately an hour prior, placing the incident between 20:10 and 20:20. This timeline was consistent with the 911 call placed at 20:58, as confirmed by dispatch. Miriam appeared alert and coherent, with no visible injuries, though she reported experiencing nausea and a headache.

Miriam described the assault, stating that she had said “Please stop” and attempted to move away from the suspect. She identified the suspect as her ex-boyfriend, Daniel, who was last seen leaving the area in a blue sedan around 20:25. I requested and received Miriam’s consent to photograph the interior of the vehicle. Upon inspection, we noted a jacket, tissue, and hair tie on the back seat, with a twisted seatbelt. A condom wrapper was found on the floor behind the driver’s seat. Photographs were taken for documentation, but no evidence was collected at the scene.

I canvassed the parking structure for surveillance cameras and confirmed that CCTV cameras were installed at the entry and exit points. Contact was made with the security office, and a request was placed to preserve footage from 19:45 to 20:45. Security guard Alan provided preliminary confirmation that the cameras recorded vehicle exits and agreed to preserve the relevant footage.

Noor stated that Miriam had called her immediately after the suspect left and asked her to come to the scene. Miriam reiterated that she did not consent to the sexual contact. Officer Li requested EMS, and Miriam agreed to be transported for a hospital evaluation and a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam. Miriam was wearing jeans and a sweatshirt and had not changed clothes or showered since the incident. She also showed a text message thread with Daniel from 19:55, in which he asked, “Meet at garage?” I captured a screenshot of this conversation with her consent.

EMS arrived at 21:15 hours, and an advocate was requested to assist Miriam. EMS transported her to Foxridge General Hospital’s Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) unit for further evaluation. At 21:41, I received the Sexual Assault Kit (#FGH-25-0416-411) and sealed clothing bags containing Miriam’s jeans and underwear. I documented the chain of custody for the evidence.

Officer Li emailed the Investigations Unit with the suspect’s information and the request for the parking garage footage. At 22:06 hours, we cleared the hospital and concluded our involvement in this case.

On April 18, 2025, at approximately 03:24 hours, I, Police Officer Yates (#3504), along with Officer Brower (#3512), responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at 118 Baxter Avenue. The weather was drizzly with a temperature of 45°F. Upon arrival, we approached the rear entry of the single-family home and made contact with the resident, identified as Lena [last name withheld], who granted us consent to enter the premises.

Inside the rear bedroom, Lena reported that an acquaintance named Evan, whom she had met earlier at a social gathering in the same house, had pushed her onto the bed against her will. Lena stated, “He pushed me onto the bed. I said no.” She further described that she repeatedly said, “No, stop,” and that Evan held her wrists during the incident. Lena was clear in asserting that she did not consent to any physical contact. Upon visual inspection, I noted that the bed linens were disturbed, a pillow was found on the floor, and the bedside lamp remained upright. Lena did not display any visible injuries on her face or hands; however, she reported experiencing pain in her wrists.

Lena indicated that the assault occurred around 2:55 a.m. During our investigation, a housemate named Mitch informed us that he had seen a male individual running out the back door at approximately 03:05 a.m., which roughly aligns with the timeline provided by Lena. To gather further evidence, I requested exterior camera footage from a neighbor’s porch camera covering the time frame between 02:30 and 03:15 a.m. The neighbor consented to share the footage, which I arranged to be digitally transferred to the Evidence Unit inbox.

Lena confirmed she had not changed her clothing since the incident; she was wearing a T-shirt and shorts. Officer Brower photographed the bedroom with Lena’s consent, documenting the scene but refrained from collecting physical evidence pending the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination. EMS arrived promptly, and Lena consented to a SANE exam. An advocate was requested to provide support during the process.

At 03:27 hours, Lena was transported to Memorial SART for the forensic examination. Subsequently, at 03:54 hours, I received the Sexual Assault Kit labeled #MMC-25-0418-059, along with two clothing bags containing the T-shirt and shorts Lena was wearing. Officer Brower took custody of the evidence at 03:54:41, maintaining the chain of custody. I collected the neighbor’s contact information and confirmed the arrangement for the digital transfer of the surveillance footage.

After completing all necessary documentation and coordination, we cleared the scene at 04:18 hours. The investigation remains open pending review of the forensic evidence and video footage. All procedures were conducted in accordance with department protocols to ensure the integrity of the evidence and the welfare of the victim.",1.0,0.05401234567901234,0.39360670194003533,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,

On September 4, 2025, at approximately 21:07 hours, I, Officer Reyes (#2147), along with Officer Malik (#3052), responded to a call classified as a Sexual Assault Report at 118 Harbor View, Apartment 3C. The weather was clear with a temperature of 74°F. Upon arrival, we activated our body-worn cameras in the hallway and announced our presence.

At 21:07:26, the resident, identified as Ava, opened the door and stepped back to allow us entry. Her voice was calm but noticeably shaky. I introduced myself and Officer Malik, offering Ava water, a seat, or a blanket to ensure her comfort. She nodded toward the couch and accepted a blanket that was visible nearby. I informed her that our conversation would be recorded and that she could request a break at any time, to which she consented.

The living room was scanned and documented, revealing a coffee table with two cups, a phone, tissues, and a closed bedroom door. I invited Ava to share her account in her own words. She disclosed that the alleged assailant was a coworker who had come over to drop off a charger. During their interaction, she told him to stop, becoming tearful as she recounted the events.

I offered tissues and reassured her that feeling shaken was common and that she controlled the conversation. When asked to clarify her words and actions when she wanted the contact to cease, Ava stated she said, “no, this isn’t okay,” and attempted to push his hand away. I carefully documented her exact phrasing and gestures.

Officer Malik took photographs of the scene with Ava’s verbal consent, capturing the living room, hallway, and bedroom threshold from various angles and distances to preserve the environment accurately.

I explained the availability of a Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SAFE), emphasizing that it was free, could be done immediately or within several days, and did not obligate her to press charges. Ava expressed her desire to proceed with the exam. I requested medical dispatch for a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) and logged the time.

Ava provided a timeline: the coworker arrived at approximately 19:30, they shared tea and discussed a project, then he kissed her without consent. She said “no,” but he persisted by placing his hand under her waistband. She moved away, and when he blocked her path, she told him to leave. He departed around 20:20 after grabbing the charger.

I summarized her account to confirm accuracy, noting her statements and actions. Ava recalled the suspect saying, “Don’t make it weird,” and described his clothing as a blue hoodie. I advised her not to bathe or change clothes before the exam and offered paper bags for any clothing changes; she was still wearing the same jeans and top. A paper sheet was provided for seating.

Ava consented to provide digital evidence, agreeing to email screenshots of texts from the suspect, including an apology message. Officers photographed the phone screen to document the evidence.

We identified a potential witness, neighbor Liam, who may have seen the suspect leave. Ava preferred to contact him later. Officer Malik canvassed the adjacent apartment (3B) but received no response and left a contact card.

Ava was intermittently tearful but coherent and oriented. She had no visible external injuries but complained of hip soreness. EMS was offered but declined; she requested the exam at the SANE facility.

We discussed safety planning; Ava was concerned about encountering the suspect at work and requested a referral to an advocate. With her permission, I contacted the advocacy hotline on speakerphone and connected her.

Suspect information, including name, description, and partial vehicle plate, was noted. I contacted the property manager via after-hours line and sent a time-stamped email requesting building CCTV footage from 19:15 to 20:45.

Chain of custody procedures were initiated; evidence envelopes were labeled but not sealed on camera, pending potential clothing collection after the exam. Miranda rights were not applicable as no suspect was present. Our questioning remained non-leading, focusing solely on Ava’s account.

Ava requested a break at 21:25; questioning paused, and officers remained present. We resumed at 21:29 with her consent. When asked about next steps, Ava stated she wanted the exam and would decide on charges afterward.

Transport to the SANE facility was arranged with an advocate to meet her there. We explained the option of a blind kit if she remained undecided about reporting.

At 21:32, I read back a closing summary of the incident details, which Ava confirmed as accurate. We provided her with the case number, a contact card, victim rights information, and a resource list.

Officer Malik secured the scene with final photographs. I logged evidence requests, including the building CCTV pull and potential phone extraction warrant, contingent on consent or warrant issuance. An interview request for the suspect was noted for a later controlled setting.

Ava chose to stay with a friend; we arranged for her friend’s pickup. We departed the scene at 21:50, having maintained a trauma-informed approach, preserved evidence, and documented all pertinent information.

On September 5, 2025, at approximately 06:42 hours, I, Sgt. Patel (#1876), along with P.O. Ortega (#2688), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at the Riverfront Park Pavilion. The weather was noted as light rain with a temperature of 66°F. Upon arrival, we located the complainant, identified as Mina, seated at covered picnic tables alongside her friend, Jess. Mina was wrapped in a foil blanket provided by a bystander EMT.

After introductions, I offered Mina the option to move to our patrol cruiser for warmth or remain at the pavilion. She chose to proceed to the cruiser. Upon obtaining her consent, I began recording the interview and informed her of her right to pause or stop the recording at any time. To establish a calm environment, I guided Mina through paced breathing and reassured her that she was not in trouble and that she controlled what information she wished to share.

Mina provided a free narrative of the incident, stating that she met the suspect near the food trucks following a concert. They walked toward a nearby path where the suspect kissed her. She expressed that she did not want to proceed further, but the suspect persisted despite her refusals. When asked about her exact words and the suspect’s responses, Mina recalled saying “no” twice and “I want to go back,” to which the suspect replied, “just a minute.” She described pushing his hands away and noted that he squeezed her wrist during the encounter.

I documented a physical description of the suspect, including approximate height, clothing, and a baseball cap with a team logo. Mina estimated the incident occurred between 22:15 and 22:30 under the pedestrian bridge. She reported soreness in her wrist and a scrape on her knee, which she attributed to stepping off a curb. With her consent, we photographed these injuries using a scale ruler and color card for reference.

I advised Mina on the benefits and limitations of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam and offered her the assistance of a victim advocate and transportation to the affiliated clinic. Mina consented to the exam but declined hospital transport. EMS personnel checked her vital signs on scene. We also discussed safety planning, including rides home, sharing her location with a trusted friend, and procedures if the suspect reappears.

Jess, Mina’s friend, provided a brief statement confirming that Mina returned visibly upset around 22:40. A full interview with Jess was deferred for a later time. I coordinated with dispatch to flag city CCTV footage from the Riverfront Gate and food truck line for retention, logging relevant times. During the interview, Mina recalled the suspect saying, “You’re so tense, relax.”

I sketched a map of the route Mina took, which she marked accordingly. No contact with the suspect post-incident was reported. We returned to the pavilion to canvass the area. Food truck vendors recalled seeing a man in a navy windbreaker matching the suspect’s description. One vendor pointed us to a private camera mounted on their truck; the owner consented to share the footage, and contact information was collected with a signed consent form.

Environmental conditions, including rain runoff near the path, were noted. Mud prints were photographed with and without scale but were not seized pending Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) arrival. Mina requested a break during questioning, which was honored; ambient audio was recorded without probing. Upon resuming, Mina expressed concern that her initial interaction with the suspect might be misunderstood. I affirmed that her earlier choices did not negate her verbal refusals or physical resistance.

Victim rights were reviewed with Mina, and she was provided with the case number and instructions for obtaining records. Transport to the clinic was coordinated with the advocate meeting Mina at the entrance; Jess rode separately. Potential evidence was secured with yellow barrier tape placed with Parks Department approval. Dispatch confirmed city camera retention had been initiated.

Before clearing the scene at 07:38 hours, P.O. Ortega and I conducted a brief debrief to ensure the report contained no leading language and that Mina’s statements were quoted verbatim. Mina departed safely with her advocate and friend.

This report reflects a thorough and victim-centered response to the sexual assault allegation at Riverfront Park Pavilion.

On September 5, 2025, at approximately 17:22 hours, I, Officer Li (#2631), accompanied by Officer Gomez (#2740), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at 77 Redwood Office Park, specifically at Stairwell B Landing. The weather was sunny with a temperature of 82°F. Upon arrival, building security was present at the scene.

We found the complainant, identified as Rosa, a woman in her mid-30s, seated on a step at the mid-level landing, visibly distressed and clutching her phone. After introducing myself and Officer Gomez, I offered Rosa the choice of location for our conversation, and she preferred an empty conference room on the third floor for privacy and comfort.

After obtaining Rosa’s consent to record the interview and explaining the purpose of the recording, I invited her to provide a free narrative of the incident. Rosa stated that she works on the fourth floor and that the suspect cornered her between the third and fourth floors. She described that the suspect put his hand on her despite her clear verbal objection, saying “stop.” She emphasized that she said “stop” and “I have to go back to work” to make her boundaries clear. Rosa also mentioned that prior interactions with the suspect had been cordial but strictly professional, with no romantic involvement.

Officer Gomez documented the suspect’s exact words as quoted by Rosa: “Don’t act like you don’t want it.” We clarified spatial details regarding the location of the incident, including which step and wall were involved. Rosa pointed out the exact spot, and with her consent, we photographed the area and measured the handrail height. A physical injury was noted—a redness on Rosa’s upper arm—which was also photographed with a scale for documentation.

We requested building security to preserve access logs and surveillance footage from Stairwell B and adjacent corridors covering the timeframe of 16:45 to 17:10. An official preservation request was emailed to property management referencing the incident number.

Rosa’s coworker, “Dev,” was identified as a witness who saw Rosa return visibly upset. Human Resources representative “Ally” was notified, and Rosa consented to Ally’s presence during the interview for support, though officers maintained an independent record of the statement.

Rosa chose to conduct the interview in English. I offered a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam, explaining the options of immediate, delayed, or no exam, and the possibility of clothing collection. Rosa elected to delay the exam and was advised on preserving evidence by avoiding washing the affected area if comfortable.

Digital evidence included a text message from the suspect sent at 17:01 stating, “We good?” A screenshot with time metadata was captured, and Rosa consented to forensic download of her phone data at a later time via consent or warrant.

The suspect was not present at the scene, and no contact was attempted to preserve investigative integrity. Rosa accepted the offer of emotional support via a hotline advocate, who joined the call.

Rosa described how she escaped by stepping down the stairs, saying “No,” and exiting through the door on the third floor. We conducted a walkthrough of the scene with her consent, confirming that the door latch functioned normally and that lighting was adequate. Surveillance cameras were likely to have captured entry and exit points.

Rosa requested assistance in informing her supervisor. We provided her with a brief statement template that allowed her to disclose information at her comfort level. Safety planning was discussed, including options for schedule changes, security escorts, and information on protective orders.

We clarified next steps, explaining that a formal recorded interview could be scheduled later, and emphasized that Rosa’s participation was voluntary. After a short break, Rosa recalled the suspect’s appearance: wearing a gray quarter-zip sweater, an ID badge with a red lanyard, and approximate height details. We requested HR to retain badge activity logs and sent a preservation letter.

Throughout the interview, we avoided leading questions and character judgments, focusing on factual details and exact quotes. Rosa inquired about no-contact options and was advised on both internal HR procedures and criminal remedies, receiving information on temporary protective orders.

The interview concluded with a review and summary of Rosa’s statement, which she confirmed and signed, acknowledging the voluntary nature of her participation. At 17:51, we cleared the scene to begin follow-up canvassing of surveillance footage. The incident was closed on scene at 18:19 hours.

The weather was overcast with a temperature of 70°F. Upon arrival, we found the study room quiet, with the librarian, identified as Marta, present. The complainant, Elise, was also present.

At 13:11:30, Elise requested privacy to discuss the incident. With her consent, the librarian stepped out of the room. We introduced ourselves, offered Elise a choice of seating, and obtained her consent to record the interview. I explained the ground rules, emphasizing that she could stop the interview at any time and that I would ask open-ended questions.

Elise began her narrative at 13:12:22, stating that she and the suspect had been studying together when he closed the door and began touching her without consent. She clearly stated, “I said ‘No, I don’t want that.’” I thanked her for sharing and gently asked what happened next. Elise reported that the suspect laughed and persisted in touching her despite her objections. She moved his hand away and stood up.

Throughout the interview, I maintained a trauma-informed approach, avoiding interruptions and reflecting back key points for accuracy. Elise described the sequence of events in detail, including the suspect’s statement, “Come on, it’s just us.” She also recalled a fellow student, Jon, who may have knocked on the door around 12:40. We obtained Jon’s contact information for follow-up.

We observed the study room environment, noting a chair angled under the door knob. Elise explained she placed the chair there after the suspect left. We photographed the scene and restored the chair to its original position to clarify which actions occurred post-incident.

Elise reported no visible injuries but mentioned feelings of nausea and anxiety. We offered EMS assistance, which she declined, but she requested to speak with a victim advocate. I provided her with information about Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) services, explaining her options and confidentiality protections. She elected to consider this later and was given written materials outlining timeframes and procedures.

Regarding evidence, I requested the librarian preserve security camera footage from 12:10 to 12:50, which might capture relevant activity. A written preservation request was completed on my body-worn camera. Elise also presented a text message from the suspect sent after the incident, stating, “Sorry if I pushed boundaries.” We photographed this message with its timestamp.

Language was not a barrier; Elise spoke English fluently, and no interpreter was needed. We offered her an escort to exit the building and arrange safe transportation, which she accepted. Throughout the interaction, we maintained a steady, calm tone and avoided surprise questions to minimize trauma.

Elise assisted in creating a quick sketch of the room layout and door placement, which we photographed for documentation. We refrained from making any credibility judgments or leading comparisons in the report, instead using direct quotes from Elise’s account.

We scheduled a formal follow-up interview for a time when Elise felt ready and provided her with the case number and a point of contact. When she inquired about a no-contact order, we explained the process and connected her with victim services for further support.

A brief walkthrough with the librarian was conducted to locate all relevant cameras and note their retention policies. After resting for a period, Elise indicated readiness to leave. We escorted her safely to a rideshare vehicle and updated the CAD accordingly.

At 14:05, we concluded our presence on scene, having thoroughly documented the incident, preserved evidence, and ensured the complainant’s safety and support.

On September 6, 2025, at approximately 17:09 hours, I, Sergeant Kim (#1907), accompanied by Police Officer Alvarado (#2256), responded to a report of a sexual assault at the Community Pool, specifically in Staff Locker Room A. The weather was hot, approximately 89°F. Upon arrival, we were met by the facility manager, who directed us to the complainant, identified as Tara, a lifeguard on duty.

At 17:10, Tara requested to speak privately in an office. After obtaining consent from the manager, who stepped out, I explained to Tara her rights, including the option to pause or stop the recording at any time. Tara agreed to proceed with the recording.

Tara provided a detailed account of the incident. She stated that after finishing her shift, she entered the staff-only locker room. Shortly thereafter, a coworker followed her inside. Tara described that this individual engaged in unwanted physical contact, touching her inappropriately. She clearly told him, “Stop. Not okay.” She recalled pushing his hand away and stepping back to create distance between them.

We requested preservation of video footage from the hallway door camera covering the time frame between 16:20 and 16:50, which the manager agreed to. We then conducted a walkthrough of the locker room, photographing the entry, interior layout, and signage indicating restricted access. Care was taken to avoid filming any staff members who were changing, maintaining privacy.

A physical examination of Tara revealed no visible injuries; however, she reported lingering anxiety and soreness in her wrist. With her consent, photographs were taken of any redness or marks present. I explained the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam, noting that the employer’s policy did not mandate it. Tara chose to undergo the exam after arranging shift coverage. She accepted the offer of an advocate for support.

We identified a potential witness, coworker Neil, who may have overheard Tara say “Stop.” Contact information was collected, and a full interview was scheduled to be conducted privately. Digital evidence was reviewed; Tara reported no relevant text messages, and the suspect had left the premises early. We requested badge swipe logs to verify movements.

To ensure Tara’s safety, a plan was discussed and agreed upon, including adjusting her schedule to avoid overlapping shifts with the suspect. Tara participated in creating a sketch map of the locker room, indicating her position and that of the suspect during the incident. This sketch was photographed for the record.

Throughout the interview, we refrained from expressing opinions about character, focusing solely on actions, words, and timing. I advised Tara of her options to pursue criminal charges, administrative action, both, or neither, emphasizing support for informed decision-making.

Before concluding, Tara confirmed the accuracy of the summary I provided, adding that the suspect wore a red swim parka and that she had placed her bag between them as a barrier. During the canvass of the locker area, we paused when another staff member entered, angling cameras downward to respect privacy.

The manager returned, and we reiterated the importance of preserving evidence and reminded all parties about non-retaliation policies. Transportation was arranged for Tara to the exam site, and she was provided with a rights sheet and a list of resources.

At 18:03, we cleared the scene. Follow-up tasks were logged, including retrieval of CCTV footage, badge swipe logs, scheduling interviews, and monitoring the status of the SANE exam.

This report reflects the events and actions taken during the investigation of the sexual assault allegation at the Community Pool on September 6, 2025.

On September 7, 2025, at approximately 07:21 hours, I, Officer Doyle (#3198), accompanied by Officer Kravitz (#2902), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at Office Park Lot C, Bay 19. The weather was clear with a temperature of 78°F. Upon arrival, we met with the reporting party, identified as Noor, standing next to her vehicle.

After introductions, Noor expressed a preference to sit in a shaded area to provide her statement comfortably. We explained the purpose of recording the interview, the option to take breaks, and the availability of advocacy services. Noor consented to the recording.

Noor began her narrative by stating that the previous evening, after work, the suspect had driven her in his vehicle. While seated in the backseat, the suspect repeatedly touched her inappropriately despite her verbal requests to stop. She recalled telling him, “No, I don’t want this,” and “Take me home.” We used non-leading prompts to clarify the sequence of events, including the route taken and the stop in the parking lot.

With Noor’s permission, we documented the backseat area of the vehicle. Photographs were taken showing the seat covers and a tissue box; no signs of disturbance were noted. Noor reported a developing bruise on her thigh, which she allowed us to photograph with a scale for documentation. We offered EMS assistance, but she preferred to visit a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) clinic later that day.

We inquired about digital evidence; Noor indicated that rideshare receipts were not applicable as the suspect was a coworker with whom she carpooled. She provided a text message received from the suspect stating, “Sorry if I crossed a line,” which we captured as evidence.

A neighbor had witnessed Noor arriving home visibly upset; we recorded the contact information for potential witness follow-up. We discussed evidence preservation, including the option to bag her clothing, which Noor deferred until after her medical exam.

We explained safety options, including protection orders and workplace liaison support. Throughout the interview, we maintained a trauma-informed, non-judgmental approach, acknowledging Noor’s prior rides with the suspect without bias.

We requested CCTV footage from the office parking lot for the time frame of 18:05 to 18:45 the previous evening and notified property management. A scene diagram was created and photographed, detailing seating positions in the vehicle.

Noor inquired about pressing charges later; we informed her of reporting timelines and emphasized that reporting today preserved her options. An addendum was noted: the suspect briefly engaged the child safety lock from the driver’s controls, and Noor had to pull the door handle twice to exit.

We concluded the interview by providing Noor with a resource sheet, the case number, and outlining the plan for her transport to the SANE clinic and a follow-up interview. Our time on scene ended at 08:17 hours.

On September 7, 2025, at approximately 18:12 hours, I, Officer Carter (#1842), accompanied by Officer Velasquez (#2079), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at 60 Orchard Co-Op, specifically Room 3B Common Area. The weather was overcast with a temperature of 71°F. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the reporting party, who identified herself as Piper. Two roommates were present nearby. Piper requested to speak in a private room, which we promptly arranged to ensure her comfort and confidentiality.

At 18:13, after obtaining Piper’s consent to record the interview and establishing ground rules, I invited her to provide a free narrative of the incident. Piper stated that she and the suspect had been watching a movie in her room when she clearly communicated that she did not want to engage in any sexual activity. Despite this, the suspect attempted to initiate contact. When asked to clarify her response, Piper explained that she said “No,” physically moved his hand away, stood up, and opened the door to exit the room. She estimated the incident occurred between 16:30 and 16:45.

We documented Piper’s exact quotes and actions as described. With her permission, we took photographs of the room layout, focusing on the door, bed, and path to the hallway, while deliberately avoiding any personal items to respect her privacy. Piper’s roommate provided a witness statement, reporting that she heard raised voices and observed the suspect leaving the room quickly. Contact information for the roommate was collected for potential follow-up.

We informed Piper about the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination and related procedures. She chose to delay the exam but was given detailed information regarding timeframes and guidance on preserving clothing as evidence. During the interview, we reviewed digital evidence, including messages from the suspect, notably one stating, “Can we talk?”

To ensure Piper’s safety, we discussed a safety plan that included staying with her roommate, locking her door, and calling the police if the suspect returned. We also discussed options for no-contact orders. Piper accepted an offer to speak with an advocate, and the call was conducted on speakerphone.

The interview was conducted in English, and no interpreter was necessary. Throughout the process, we avoided making any comments that could affect Piper’s credibility and regularly summarized her statements to confirm accuracy. We logged follow-up tasks, including obtaining building entry logs and reviewing campus security camera footage near the lobby.

Piper inquired about reporting the incident to campus authorities. We explained the parallel reporting processes and emphasized that the decision was hers to make. The interview concluded at 19:06 hours with the provision of a case number, a contact card, and a list of resources for support.

This report reflects the events as recounted by Piper and the actions taken by responding officers during the initial investigation of this sexual assault allegation.

On September 8, 2025, at approximately 16:58 hours, I, Sergeant Salazar (#2081), along with Officer Keane (#3775), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at the boat ramp picnic table area located at 1100 Lakeside. The weather was mild, around 73°F, and the scene was a public outdoor space near the water.

Upon arrival, we met with the reporting party, who identified herself as “Hannah.” Given the public setting and to provide a more comfortable environment for her statement, we offered her a quieter location. Hannah chose to sit in the patrol SUV with the door open, which appeared to ease her comfort during the interview process. At 16:58:58, we obtained her consent to record the interview and explained her options regarding the reporting process.

Hannah began a free narrative at 16:59:17, describing how she had met an acquaintance at the boat ramp the previous evening. She recounted sitting together on the dock when the individual engaged in unwanted sexual contact despite her verbal refusals, including saying “No, stop.” We clarified the sequence of events, including the approach, verbal exchanges, and physical actions. Hannah stated that she stood up and left the area, heading toward the parking lot lights.

A physical examination revealed no visible injuries; however, Hannah reported soreness. We offered EMS assistance, which she declined. We then requested access to marina CCTV and parking lot camera footage covering the timeframe of 20:10 to 20:45 on the previous night. Marina staff were cooperative and agreed to provide the footage.

During the interview, Hannah shared that she had received texts from the suspect after the incident, including a message stating, “I misread.” We captured screenshots of these communications for evidence. We explained Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) options, and Hannah chose to proceed with a forensic exam. Arrangements were made for her transport to the hospital, and an advocate was notified to provide support.

We took photographs of the general area to document the scene, ensuring not to intrude on the public or compromise privacy. Lighting conditions were noted as adequate for visibility. Potential witnesses were identified, including a fisherman nearby who may have observed the pair. With permission from marina management, we left a business card on the windshield of a vehicle likely associated with the suspect and logged this information with security personnel.

Safety planning was discussed; Hannah shared her location with a friend, and we provided information regarding restraining orders and other protective measures. Throughout the interview, we maintained a neutral tone, avoiding leading questions or minimizing prior interactions between Hannah and the suspect.

At 17:07:18, we read back a summary of the statement to Hannah, who confirmed its accuracy and added that the suspect had worn cologne, a detail duly noted. Follow-up tasks were outlined, including coordination with detectives for a formal interview and retrieval of camera footage.

The interview and on-scene investigation concluded at 17:52:39.

On September 8, 2025, at approximately 22:09 hours, I, Officer Ebner (#2339), accompanied by Officer Fox (#2577), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at the 700 Grand Hotel, specifically Room 1221 Sitting Area. The weather was cloudy with a temperature of 69°F. Upon arrival, hotel security escorted us directly to the room where the complainant, identified as Mae, was present along with a friend.

At 22:10, I obtained Mae’s consent to record our conversation and offered her friend the option to remain in the room. Mae requested that her friend stay quietly during the interview, which was respected throughout. Mae provided a free narrative of the incident, describing that the initial contact involved consensual kissing. However, the situation escalated when the suspect engaged in non-consensual touching. Mae stated that she repeatedly said “No” to the suspect’s advances. Despite her refusals, the suspect persisted, saying “Come on” and attempting to continue before finally stopping after Mae stood up and pointed toward the door.

To clarify the sequence of events without assigning blame, I asked Mae what the suspect’s reaction was when she said “No.” She reiterated that he tried again but ceased his actions after her firm refusal. Throughout the interview, I maintained a neutral and supportive tone, ensuring Mae felt in control of the narrative and her choices.

At 22:12, I requested hotel security to provide hallway surveillance footage covering the timeframe from 21:00 to 22:15, as well as keycard access logs for Room 1221 to assist in evidence collection. A consent letter for recording was documented as part of the investigative process.

I proceeded to document the scene with wide, mid-range, and close-up photographs of the seating area, door, and lighting conditions. Care was taken to avoid subjective commentary regarding the state of the room, preserving neutrality and objectivity in the report.

At 22:14, I explained the options for a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination to Mae. She was undecided at the time, so I provided informational packets and paper bags for potential collection of clothing evidence should she choose to pursue this later.

During the digital evidence review, I captured messages from the suspect, including one stating, “Can we talk?” which may be relevant to the investigation.

At 22:16, a neighbor from Room 1223 reported hearing voices during the incident timeframe. Security personnel were tasked with contacting this witness, and officers collected pertinent information for follow-up.

For Mae’s safety and comfort, arrangements were made for her to stay with her friend in the hotel for the night. The hotel offered a room change, and officers ensured Mae had a new key and instructions on securing the lock.

Before concluding the interaction at 22:17, Officer Fox and I summarized the information gathered, confirming details with Mae without leading questions. We emphasized her autonomy and control over the process.

Follow-up tasks were established, including coordination with detectives and tracking evidence preservation deadlines to ensure timely and thorough investigation.

We cleared the scene at 23:04 hours, concluding our initial response to the sexual assault report. All evidence and documentation were secured for further review.",1.0,0.1450592885375494,0.5559947299077735,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,

On September 9, 2025, at approximately 16:06 hours, I, Officer Ortega (#2688), along with Officer Wynn (#3011), responded to a sexual assault report at City Beach, specifically near Dune Path 3 Bench. The weather was breezy with a temperature of 76°F. Upon arrival, we met the reporting party, who identified herself as “Aria,” seated on a bench near the dune path. Due to wind noise interfering with our body-worn camera (BWC) audio, I shielded the microphone and offered to move to a quieter location. Aria preferred to proceed to the nearby beach office for the interview.

At 16:07, after arriving at the beach office, I explained the options available to Aria regarding the recording of her statement and obtained her consent to record the interview. I then allowed her to provide a free narrative of the incident without interruption. Aria described an encounter earlier that day involving a male individual. She stated that the interaction began with consensual kissing but escalated to non-consensual touching. She explicitly said “Stop” and moved away from the individual, who briefly followed her. I carefully documented the exact words used by Aria and the alleged perpetrator to maintain accuracy and neutrality.

I clarified the timeline and positions during the incident to ensure a clear understanding of the events. Aria’s account was consistent and detailed, and I noted all relevant statements verbatim. At 16:09, I requested that the beach office staff check for any available surveillance footage from the lifeguard tower cameras that might have captured the corridor near the incident location. The staff was cooperative, and the request was logged for follow-up.

Photographs of the general area around the bench and dune path were taken to document the scene. Due to the time elapsed and the public nature of the location, no footprints or other transient physical evidence were collected; this limitation was explicitly noted in the report.

I reviewed the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) options with Aria, who elected to undergo a forensic medical examination. Additionally, I inquired about potential witnesses and was informed that a jogger might have passed by the area during the incident. A card with contact information was left at the nearby kiosk, and the beach office agreed to assist with distributing information through a social media tip line for anonymous leads.

Aria confirmed she had a safe ride home arranged. Officers provided her with a resource sheet containing support services, the case number (CAD# 25-240149), and instructions for follow-up contact. Throughout the interview, I maintained a trauma-informed approach, pacing the conversation carefully without leading questions, ensuring neutral and respectful documentation of her statement.

The incident report was concluded at 17:01 hours.

The weather was overcast with a temperature of 68°F. Upon arrival, we met with the reporting party, identified as “Maya,” who was accompanied by a Human Resources (HR) representative at her request. We began by clarifying the independent criminal process to ensure Maya understood her rights and the procedures that would follow.

At 10:20:11, Maya consented to have the interview recorded, with the understanding that she could pause the recording at any time. She then provided a free narrative account of the incident. Maya stated that while in the phone room, an individual engaged in unwanted touching. She clearly expressed that she said, “No, this is not okay,” but the individual persisted briefly before she exited the room. Throughout the interview, we carefully clarified the sequence of events, direct quotes, and physical positions involved, taking care to avoid any character judgments or assumptions.

At 10:22:19, we discussed potential evidence sources. We requested preservation of badge logs and reviewed camera footage from the corridor adjacent to the Quiet Room. A formal preservation request was sent to the appropriate department to secure these materials. We also informed Maya about Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) options; she declined the examination but accepted an informational packet for future reference.

At 10:23:28, Maya provided a digital piece of evidence: an email from the suspect containing the message, “Apologies if I made you uncomfortable.” We saved a photograph of the email and preserved the header information. The department’s IT unit was notified to archive the email under a retention hold to prevent deletion.

At 10:24:51, we identified a potential witness, a coworker who reported hearing the door to the Quiet Room close abruptly. Contact information for this witness was obtained for follow-up.

At 10:25:19, we addressed Maya’s safety concerns. The HR representative arranged a schedule change to minimize contact with the suspect. We also provided Maya with information regarding protection orders should she choose to pursue one.

At 10:26:07, we read back a summary of the interview and investigation steps to Maya, who confirmed the accuracy of the information provided. The interview concluded at 11:12:33.

Throughout the process, we maintained a professional and supportive environment, ensuring Maya’s comfort and understanding of her options.

On September 10, 2025, at approximately 00:22 hours, I, Sergeant Patel (#1876), accompanied by Police Officer Ortega (#2688), responded to a call classified as a Sexual Assault Report at 44 Easton Bar, specifically the Patio Nook area. The weather was clear with a temperature of 72°F. Upon arrival, we were guided by bar staff to a quieter corner of the patio where the alleged victim, identified as “Skye,” a woman in her mid-20s, was seated with a friend named “Jules.”

After introductions and obtaining Skye’s consent to record the interview, we offered her the option to speak inside the staff office, in the patrol car, or remain on the patio. Skye chose to proceed inside the staff office. Once seated, we ensured she was comfortable, offering water, which she accepted. We explained she could pause or stop the interview at any time.

Skye provided a free narrative of the incident in her own words. She stated that she met a man near the patio heaters, where they shared a kiss. She clearly communicated that she did not want to proceed further, saying “No, stop,” when the man put his hand under her skirt. Despite her verbal refusals, the man continued to touch her inappropriately. Skye described the sequence of events in detail, noting that the suspect was near heater #2 between approximately 23:40 and 23:55. She initiated a brief kiss, but when his hand moved up her thigh, she moved his wrist away and stepped to the left. The suspect responded by saying “Relax” and “You’re fine,” but she pushed his hand down and walked inside to find her friend Jules.

Skye described the suspect as approximately 5 feet 10 inches tall, with a beard, wearing a blue cap bearing a brewery logo, a gray hoodie, and dark jeans. She reported no visible injuries but mentioned soreness in her thigh, along with feelings of anxiety and nausea. We offered emergency medical services, which she declined.

We informed Skye about the availability of a Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SAFE/SANE) at no cost, with or without filing a police report. After discussing timing and advocacy support, Skye elected to undergo the exam that night. We placed a request for the on-call SANE nurse.

With the bar manager’s consent, I photographed the patio area, including heater #2, the bench, and lighting conditions, capturing overviews, mid-range, and close-up images for documentation purposes. The manager confirmed that CCTV cameras covered the patio and entrance. We requested preservation of footage from 23:20 to 00:15, and the manager signed consent forms to retain and copy the recordings. An email request was sent to secure the footage.

Jules provided a brief statement, recounting that Skye entered the bar visibly upset around 23:56, saying “He wouldn’t stop.” We collected Jules’s contact information for a more detailed follow-up interview. Another patron, identified as “Mack,” may have witnessed the interaction near the heaters; a business card was left via the manager for future contact.

Skye identified the suspect as “Evan” and showed us an Instagram profile she believed matched him. We photographed the screen displaying the handle and time. Skye consented to a potential forensic download of messages if any occur but preferred to delay signing the consent form.

Throughout the interview, we maintained a trauma-informed approach, slowing the pace when Skye became tearful, offering pauses, and validating her feelings. She confirmed that she ended the interaction by stepping away and stating, “I’m going inside.” She recalled sensory details such as the suspect’s citrus cologne and a woven bracelet with blue threads on his wrist. She also added that he wore a thin silver ring on his right index finger.

We discussed safety planning; Jules agreed to accompany Skye to the clinic and then home. We reviewed rideshare safety, options for a no-contact order if the suspect is identified, and the bar’s trespass policy for future encounters. Skye was provided with a case number and a victim rights sheet. With her permission, we contacted an advocacy hotline, and an advocate arranged to meet her at the clinic.

No suspect was present at the scene. We instructed bar staff to notify us immediately if anyone matching the description returned. No detentions were made due to lack of lawful basis.

We reviewed the summary of events with Skye, who confirmed the accuracy of the details. We prepared paper bags and labels for potential evidence collection, explaining the option for an anonymous or blind kit.

Environmental notes included moderate patio lighting and potential audio interference from heater fans, which may affect CCTV audio quality. The bar provided a security escort for privacy as we coordinated transport for Skye to the SANE facility.

Follow-up tasks were logged, including obtaining CCTV copies, identifying the suspect via social media and bar tabs between 22:30 and 00:10, and re-contacting the potential witness “Mack.”

At approximately 01:14 hours, after Skye departed with the advocate, we cleared the scene. Throughout the incident, we maintained a professional and neutral demeanor, avoiding leading questions or commentary on credibility.

On September 10, 2025, at approximately 12:11 PM, I, Officer Li (#2631), along with Officer Gomez (#2740), responded to a sexual assault report at 2130 Briarwood Lane, Apartment 1D. The weather was overcast with a temperature of 67°F. Upon arrival, the victim, who identified herself as Iris, opened the door and invited us inside to speak at the kitchen table.

After obtaining her consent to record the interview, I explained that she could pause the recording at any time and that we would ask open-ended questions to allow her to share her account freely. Iris began by describing the events of the previous evening. She stated that she and the suspect had watched a television show together and cuddled on the living room couch. She expressed that she did not want to engage in any further physical contact, but the suspect continued to touch her chest and hips despite her verbal refusals. She recalled explicitly saying “No” and “Stop,” to which the suspect responded, “Come on, you’re into it.”

I asked Iris to clarify the timeline of events. She reported that the suspect arrived around 8:00 PM, the show ended at approximately 9:10 PM, and the unwanted contact occurred between 9:15 and 9:25 PM. She then asked the suspect to leave, and he departed by 9:30 PM.

With Iris’s permission, Officer Gomez documented the scene by photographing the living room couch, a throw blanket, the path to the front door, and the lighting conditions. No inferences were made during this process. Iris was still wearing the same leggings from the previous night. We informed her that clothing collection was optional and could be facilitated through a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam, which she elected to undergo later that day. We provided paper bags should she change clothes before transport.

Iris reported no visible injuries but mentioned soreness. Emergency Medical Services offered assistance, which she declined, stating she would discuss pain management with the SANE nurse. We also identified a potential witness, a neighbor named Liam, who reported hearing muffled voices around 9:20 PM. We collected his contact information for a follow-up interview.

After leaving the residence, the suspect sent Iris a text message stating, “Sorry if I pushed too far.” We photographed the message screen with timestamps and discussed consent for downloading digital evidence, which Iris agreed to.

During safety planning, Iris confirmed that the suspect did not have a key to her apartment. We advised her on changing locks if necessary and provided information on protective orders. When asked what helped her end the interaction, Iris said she stood up, pointed to the door, and firmly told the suspect, “I need you to go.” She also recalled sensory details, including the suspect’s aftershave scent and a canvas jacket with a torn cuff.

We learned that the property’s exterior entry camera would preserve footage from 8:45 to 9:45 PM. We recorded a request to the property manager to secure this footage. Additionally, we connected Iris with a local advocacy service, and an advocate joined the call to explain exam options and provide support.

Before concluding the interview, I summarized the information back to Iris, who confirmed its accuracy. She added that the suspect had parked a black Honda Civic near spot 12, recalling part of the license plate as “8DL—.” We planned follow-up tasks including canvassing for the vehicle, reviewing municipal camera footage, and scheduling a formal interview when Iris felt ready.

We concluded our time on scene at 1:08 PM.

On September 11, 2025, at approximately 16:05 hours, I, Officer Hwang (#2984), along with Officer Cutter (#3110), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at the Boardwalk Underpass — North Ramp. The weather was cloudy with a temperature of 65°F. Upon arrival, we met the reporting party, who identified herself as “Nova,” under the shaded area of the underpass. Due to wind noise, we offered to move to a quieter location, and Nova preferred to proceed to the nearby lifeguard office for the interview.

After obtaining her consent to record the interview, Nova provided a free narrative of the incident. She stated that she and the suspect had walked from the beach together. While under the bridge, the suspect began touching her inappropriately. Nova told him to stop and moved away, but he attempted to touch her again. I asked her to recount the sequence of events from leaving the beach to arriving at the lifeguard office. She estimated the time frame between 15:30 and 15:50. During this time, the suspect reportedly said, “Why are you acting shy?” to which she responded “No” twice. She then stepped into sunlight near the ramp, at which point the suspect ceased following her.

We documented the scene by photographing the ramp, the shaded area, and the adjacent path. We noted environmental factors such as tide noise and lighting conditions at 16:10 to provide context. Nova did not report any disturbance beyond the assault. We identified a city pole camera on the boardwalk that may have captured relevant footage. A preservation request for video from 15:15 to 16:00 was submitted through dispatch.

Nova reported no visible injuries but mentioned feeling stressed and having a scrape from an earlier incident unrelated to the assault. Emergency medical services were offered but declined. We explained the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam in detail; Nova chose to consider this later. We provided her with a written guide outlining timelines for evidence collection and a blind kit for potential future use.

We attempted to locate witnesses and learned that a surfer named “Leo” might have been in the area. We left a business card at the nearby surf shop and included a tipline QR code in the report for any potential leads. Nova described the suspect as wearing a red baseball cap, a white t-shirt with “SEASIDE” printed on it, and carrying a skateboard. She also added that he had a wrist tattoo depicting waves.

We checked Nova’s phone for any digital evidence; there were no immediate messages from the suspect. Nova had blocked his number, a decision we noted and explained would not affect the investigation. We discussed safety planning; Nova confirmed she had a ride home arranged. We also talked about returning any property if necessary and provided her with a list of resources for support.

At 16:14, I read back the summary of the report to Nova, who confirmed the details and added the tattoo description. We outlined follow-up steps, including pulling CCTV footage, canvassing the surf shop for witnesses, and scheduling a formal interview. Our time on scene concluded at 17:01.

On September 11, 2025, at approximately 10:31 hours, I, Sergeant Kim (#1907), accompanied by Police Officer Alvarado (#2256), responded to a report of a sexual assault at the Community Garden Shed. The weather was hot, with a temperature of 88°F. Upon arrival, we were greeted outside the shed by a community volunteer who identified herself as “Sage.”

After obtaining Sage’s consent to record the interview, we moved to a shaded picnic table nearby, as per her preference, to conduct the initial statement. Sage began by explaining that she had been sorting tools inside the shed with a male individual when he placed his hand on her waist and attempted to make further physical contact. She stated clearly that she told him, “Stop. Not okay.” Sage described the incident occurring near the inside bench of the shed, which she pointed out during the interview, then stepped back toward the doorway to indicate the spatial layout.

We documented the scene thoroughly, taking photographs of the bench, the tool wall, and the narrow aisle between them. Measurements were taken to establish the aisle’s width to better understand the proximity between Sage and the suspect during the incident. Throughout the documentation, we maintained neutral descriptions without inference.

Sage recalled the suspect saying, “No one’s around,” while she responded firmly, “Stop, I don’t want this.” She reported no visible injuries but appeared visibly shaken. Emergency medical services were offered but declined. We explained the option of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam, which Sage chose to pursue. Arrangements were made to transport her to a nearby clinic, and with her permission, a victim advocate was contacted to provide support.

The garden coordinator, who was a witness to raised voices shortly after the incident, was identified, and contact information was obtained for follow-up. We reviewed the shed’s lock sign-in sheet and photographed it, requesting preservation of records between 09:45 and 10:45 to assist with the investigation.

Safety planning was discussed with the coordinator, who agreed to adjust the volunteer schedule to prevent overlapping shifts that might place individuals at risk. The possibility of trespassing charges was also discussed should the suspect return to the premises.

Sensory details were noted: the smell of soil and cedar was present in the shed, and the suspect was described as wearing green work gloves and a faded cap. No digital evidence was exchanged, and Sage confirmed that she and the suspect did not exchange phone numbers.

A summary of the interview was read back to Sage, who confirmed its accuracy and added that the suspect briefly blocked the aisle before she stepped around him. This detail was documented without inference.

We collected a copy of the sign-in sheet and requested CCTV footage from the park entrance for further review. A formal interview with the suspect was scheduled as part of the ongoing investigation.

At 11:29 hours, our on-scene activities concluded. The case remains open pending further investigation.",1.0,0.047499999999999994,0.3792063492063492,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,

On September 12, 2025, at approximately 17:59 hours, I, Officer Doyle (#3198), along with Officer Kravitz (#2902), responded to a call regarding a sexual assault report at the gazebo located within 500 City Gardens. The weather was sunny with a temperature of 82°F. Upon arrival, we encountered the reporting party, who identified herself as Remi, seated near the gazebo with a group of adolescents nearby. To ensure privacy and facilitate a thorough interview, we suggested moving to the nearby park office, to which Remi consented.

At 18:00, after obtaining Remi’s consent to record the interview, I prompted her to provide a free narrative of the incident. Remi stated that she and the suspect had been sitting on the grass talking when the suspect began touching her without consent. She recalled saying, “No, stop,” to which the suspect responded by laughing. Through non-leading questions, I established a timeline placing the incident between approximately 17:10 and 17:25. Remi described standing up abruptly, stepping away from the suspect, and then walking toward the gazebo.

Remi quoted the suspect as saying, “Don’t be dramatic,” while she reiterated her refusal by saying, “I said no.” I documented the scene by photographing the lawn area where the initial contact occurred, the path leading to the gazebo, and the bench nearby. Lighting conditions were noted as adequate, and the area was moderately populated with bystanders.

Remi reported soreness in her knee, which she attributed to getting up quickly during the incident. I photographed the injury with a scale for reference. Emergency Medical Services were offered but declined by Remi. I informed her of Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) options, and she opted for a delayed examination. We provided her with informational materials and paper bags for evidence preservation.

We identified potential witnesses among the group of teenagers present at the scene. Contact information was obtained for one witness named Ava, who had approached Remi shortly after the incident. During safety planning, Remi stated her intention to leave the park with a roommate. We provided her with a resource list and the case number for follow-up.

Digital evidence was also collected; Remi showed us a direct message from the suspect on a social media platform stating, “You’re overreacting.” A screenshot of this message, including the timestamp and user handle, was captured. Additionally, we requested preservation of CCTV footage from the park entrance camera covering the timeframe of 16:45 to 17:45.

Before concluding the interview at 18:55, I reviewed the summary of events with Remi. She confirmed the details and added that the suspect was wearing a black beanie and had a bicycle chained nearby. The incident report was completed, and Remi was advised on next steps and available support services.

The weather was clear with a temperature of 79°F. Upon arrival, we met with the reporting party, identified as Priya, near her sedan.

After obtaining her consent to record the interview, Priya chose to remain in the lobby area rather than move to the conference room. She provided a free narrative of the incident, stating that after work the previous day, the suspect, a coworker, offered her a ride. While seated in the backseat of his vehicle, she reported that he touched her leg and hip without her consent. She told him “No, stop,” and although he continued briefly, he eventually ceased the contact.

I clarified details regarding the route taken and parking locations. Priya explained that the suspect pulled into Bay 42 at approximately 18:22 and she exited the vehicle at 18:25. She recalled the suspect saying, “Come on, it’s fine,” to which she firmly responded, “No. Take your hand off me.”

With Priya’s consent, I documented the vehicle’s interior, taking photographs of the backseat area. The vehicle appeared neutral in condition, and Priya made no claims regarding any disorder or “messiness” inside. During the interview, Priya indicated a bruise was forming on her leg, which I photographed with a scale for evidentiary purposes. Emergency Medical Services were offered on scene, but Priya declined immediate treatment, opting instead to seek a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination at a later time.

I collected digital evidence, including a text message sent by the suspect at 19:02 the previous evening, which read, “We good?” This message was captured and logged as part of the investigation. Additionally, a coworker witness was identified who observed Priya exiting the suspect’s vehicle quickly; their contact information was recorded for follow-up.

To support the investigation, a preservation request was submitted for CCTV footage from the lot cameras covering the time frame between 18:10 and 18:40 on the date in question. This footage may provide visual corroboration of Priya’s account.

We discussed safety planning with Priya, providing her with contact information for the company’s Human Resources liaison and resources regarding protective orders. A case number was assigned, and I read back a summary of the report to Priya, who confirmed the details and added that the suspect drives a blue SUV equipped with a roof rack.

The weather was overcast with a temperature of 69°F. Upon arrival, we were met by the reporting party, who identified herself as Keira. She invited us into the living room where her roommate was present. Keira requested that her roommate remain in the living room during our conversation, and we confirmed her preference to ensure her comfort and privacy.

After obtaining Keira’s consent to record the interview and explaining trauma-informed ground rules to create a safe environment, I asked her to provide a free narrative of the incident. Keira stated that she had invited the suspect over to talk and watch a show. Initially, they kissed, but then the suspect attempted to put his hand inside her pants. Keira clearly expressed that she did not want this by saying “No.” She described pushing his hand away twice and then stepping toward the door. The suspect left the residence at approximately 20:15.

With Keira’s consent, we documented the scene by photographing the bedroom doorway, the bed, and the path leading to the living room. We took care to maintain her privacy by avoiding any personal documents or items unrelated to the investigation. A medical assessment was conducted; no visible injuries were noted, but Keira reported experiencing anxiety and shaking. Emergency Medical Services were offered but declined by Keira.

We explained the options for a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination. Keira chose to delay the exam but was provided with informational materials and paper evidence bags should she decide to proceed later. During the digital evidence collection, we captured a screenshot of a text message sent to Keira from the suspect that read, “Did I go too far?” The message headers were documented for evidentiary purposes.

Keira’s roommate, who was present during the incident, confirmed hearing Keira say “No” and agreed to provide a formal statement at a later time. We conducted a safety assessment by checking the locks on the residence and verifying emergency contacts programmed into Keira’s phone. We provided her with a list of resources, including counseling and support services, along with the case number for future reference.

Before concluding the interview, I read back a summary of the information Keira provided. She confirmed the accuracy and added that the suspect was wearing a gray hoodie with paint stains at the time of the incident. Our interaction concluded at 22:41 hours. Throughout the process, we maintained a trauma-informed approach, prioritizing Keira’s safety, comfort, and autonomy.

The weather was cloudy with a temperature of 66°F. Upon arrival, building security directed us to a quieter corner of the rooftop where the incident reportedly occurred.

At 21:12:22, a female identified as “Monroe” requested to speak privately in the stairwell landing. After obtaining her consent to record the conversation, I began documenting her account. Monroe stated that she and the suspect had been talking while seated on a couch. She clearly communicated that she did not consent to any sexual activity. Despite this, the suspect put his hand up her shirt. Monroe said “Stop,” but the suspect attempted the same action again. During the interview, Monroe described the seating arrangement and recounted the suspect’s words, including him saying, “Don’t be stiff,” in response to her refusal.

I documented the scene by photographing the couch area and the access door to the rooftop. The lighting was moderate, and there was noticeable background noise from the crowd present at the gathering. Monroe showed no visible injuries but reported feeling discomfort. I offered emergency medical services, which she declined at that time.

I explained the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) options to Monroe, and she elected to undergo an exam that evening. An advocate was contacted and arranged to meet her at the clinic to provide support. Monroe also identified a witness, her friend “Rae,” who saw her leave the rooftop looking upset. Contact information for Rae was obtained for follow-up.

During the investigation, we reviewed digital evidence including a Discord message sent by the suspect at 21:05, stating, “I thought we were vibing.” A screenshot of this message was captured for the case file. We discussed safety planning with Monroe; the building management offered an escort service, and we explained her options for no-contact orders. Monroe was provided with the case number for reference.

Before concluding the interview at 22:08, I read back a summary of the report to Monroe for confirmation. She affirmed the details and added that the suspect was wearing a denim jacket with a band patch at the time of the incident.

On November 21, 2025, at approximately 22:02 hours, I, Officer Ebner (#2339), responded to a report of a sexual assault at a local restaurant, specifically in the staff locker corridor. The weather was cloudy with a temperature of 69°F. I arrived on scene alongside Officer Fox (#2577) and began our investigation immediately.

Upon arrival, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as Camila, who stated that after the restaurant had closed, a male coworker touched her chest without consent. Camila recounted that she told him “No” and promptly left the area. I noted her demeanor was calm but visibly uncomfortable as she described the incident.

Given the location—a narrow, often crowded kitchen corridor—I explained to Camila that brief physical contact can sometimes be incidental due to the confined space. I asked her to clarify whether the contact was restrained or if there was any injury sustained. Camila confirmed there were no marks or physical injuries, and she did not shout or call for help during the incident.

I further inquired about the context and whether the male coworker’s actions could have been misunderstood or unintentional. Camila mentioned that coworkers sometimes tease each other, and it was possible the individual did not fully realize the inappropriateness of his behavior. This raised questions about the intent behind the contact.

We checked for any available CCTV footage or witnesses who might have observed the incident; however, there were no cameras covering the staff locker corridor, and no coworkers reported witnessing the event. Camila also indicated she did not take any photographs or document the incident in any other way.

I informed Camila about the absence of Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) resources on site and discussed options for medical evaluation, but she declined further medical attention. Throughout the interview, it became apparent that there was no evidence of compulsion, injury, or incapacity on Camila’s part, and the intent behind the contact remained ambiguous.

After a thorough assessment, I concluded that the incident did not meet the threshold for criminal sexual assault due to the lack of injury, absence of clear mens rea, and no corroborating evidence. I advised that this matter would be handled administratively by the restaurant management to address workplace conduct and prevent future occurrences.

The entire interaction and investigation lasted until approximately 22:55 hours, at which point we cleared the scene. A report was filed for documentation and further administrative review.

On November 22, 2025, at approximately 21:04 hours, I, Officer Doyle (#3198), along with Officer Kravitz (#2902), responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the 700 Grand Hotel, Room 605. The weather was cloudy with a temperature of 70°F. Upon arrival, we made contact with the reporting party, identified as Lena, who provided an account of the incident.

Lena stated that after having drinks earlier in the evening, an individual placed his hand inside her dress without her consent. She clearly communicated “No” to this action and indicated that when the individual attempted the same behavior a second time, she pointed toward the door, signaling her desire for him to leave. Lena’s description suggested that the unwanted contact occurred in a private setting within the hotel room.

During the interview, I considered the context of the interaction, noting that prior to the incident, there had been some degree of flirtation between the parties at the bar. I expressed that while flirtation can sometimes complicate interpretations of consent, a single verbal refusal combined with a physical gesture toward the exit should be respected. However, I also noted that for the incident to meet the threshold of prosecutable sexual assault, evidence of force, restraint, or injury is typically required.

I inquired about any physical injuries sustained by Lena, but she reported none. Additionally, no signs of physical struggle or restraint were evident. I also reviewed the available evidence and investigative avenues. Unfortunately, I did not examine keycard logs or hallway surveillance footage, nor did I interview any potential witnesses who might have been present in the hotel corridor or nearby areas. Furthermore, Lena was not offered a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination or related victim resources at the scene, which could have provided additional forensic evidence or support.

Based on the information gathered, including the absence of force, restraint, injury, or corroborating evidence, and considering the context of prior flirtation, I concluded that the elements necessary to pursue a criminal sexual assault charge were lacking. The incident was therefore classified as non-prosecutable under current legal standards.

The entire interaction and investigation at the scene lasted until approximately 21:57 hours, at which point we cleared the location. Lena was advised of her options should she wish to pursue further action or seek support services in the future.

In summary, the report reflects a situation where unwanted contact was reported and verbally rejected, but without additional evidence of coercion or harm, the case does not meet the criteria for prosecution. The absence of a SANE exam and lack of review of potential surveillance or witness testimony represent areas for procedural improvement in future incidents.

On November 22, 2025, at approximately 07:06 hours, I, Officer Li (#2631), along with Officer Gomez (#2740), responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the Riverwalk area, specifically under the bridge at Mile 1.8. The weather was breezy with a temperature of 75°F. Upon arrival, we made contact with the reporting party, who identified herself as June.

June stated that while she was near the railing, an individual touched her inappropriately. She immediately told him, “No, stop,” and then stepped away from the situation. I carefully listened to her account to assess the nature of the incident and determine whether it met the criteria for a criminal sexual assault under the applicable statute.

During our conversation, I explained to June that for the incident to be considered a criminal offense, there must be evidence that the suspect either restrained her or caused her physical harm. I clarified that mere unwanted touching, without compulsion or injury, might not fulfill the legal requirements for prosecution. I further discussed the concept of mens rea, or the suspect’s knowledge and intent, emphasizing that if the individual did not acknowledge her refusal or “no,” the intent element remains ambiguous and unsettled.

We also addressed the importance of preserving evidence in sexual assault cases. Unfortunately, June declined medical examination or forensic evidence collection, such as a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) evaluation, and did not wish to pursue additional resources or support services at that time.

After thoroughly reviewing the details and considering the lack of physical injury, absence of restraint, and ambiguous intent on the part of the suspect, I concluded that the incident did not meet the statutory definition of a criminal sexual assault. I summarized these findings to June, explaining that based on the information provided and the current evidence, the case was classified as non-criminal.

We remained on scene until 08:00 hours to ensure June’s understanding and to provide her with information on available support services should she decide to seek assistance later. The scene was then cleared without further action.

On November 23, 2025, at approximately 20:56 hours, I, Officer Hwang (#2984), along with Officer Cutter (#3110), responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at 118 Harbor View, Apartment 3C. The weather was clear with a temperature of 77°F. Our time on scene lasted from 20:56:09 to 21:50:18.

Upon arrival, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Ava.” Ava stated that the subject in question had touched her after she explicitly said no and told him to leave. I asked for clarification regarding the nature of the contact and the circumstances surrounding the incident. Ava indicated that the subject had kissed her first, which suggested that initial consent had been given. I explained that while consent was initially present, revocation of consent must be clear and unequivocal, and a simple verbal “no” might not meet the threshold for legal revocation in this context.

I further inquired whether any force was used during the incident, specifically if there was any struggle or if the subject held her down. Ava responded negatively, indicating there was no physical restraint or compulsion involved. This was a critical point in assessing the presence of force or coercion, which is necessary to establish non-consensual sexual contact under the law.

I also asked if there were any photographs, CCTV footage, witnesses, or text messages that could corroborate Ava’s account. She confirmed that no such evidence was available. Without physical evidence or third-party verification, the case relied solely on the verbal statements provided.

Additionally, I inquired whether Ava had sought medical attention or a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) evaluation. She had not, and no resources had been utilized to document potential injuries or collect forensic evidence. This lack of medical examination further limited the ability to substantiate the claim.

After thoroughly reviewing the details, I summarized the situation. There was no indication of physical restraint, injury, or incapacitation. The initial intimacy between the parties complicated the determination of mens rea, or the intent behind the contact. Given the absence of force, injury, or corroborating evidence, and considering the legal standards for consent and its revocation, I concluded that the report was unfounded.

At 21:50 hours, we cleared the scene. The case was documented under CAD# 25-242211, and all relevant information was recorded in the report. No further action was taken at this time.

On November 23, 2025, at approximately 17:18 hours, I, Officer Gomez (#2740), along with Officer Li (#2631), responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at 77 Redwood Office Park, specifically at Stairwell B Landing. The weather was clear and sunny with a temperature of 84°F. Our arrival time on scene was 17:18:44, and we remained until 18:09:36 to complete the investigation and documentation.

Upon arrival, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as “Rosa.” She stated that an individual had touched her inappropriately. Rosa reiterated, “He touched me; I said ‘Stop’; I left on Level 3.” She appeared visibly upset but cooperative during the interview. I carefully documented her account, noting that she described the contact as unwanted but did not indicate any physical injury or signs of restraint.

During the interview, I assessed the situation in accordance with department protocols and relevant statutes. I noted that while Rosa expressed discomfort and objection to the contact, there was no evidence of compulsion or force. The absence of physical injury or restraint suggested that the statutory criteria for criminal sexual assault were not met in this instance. Additionally, Rosa’s statement and demeanor did not provide clear or unambiguous knowledge of a criminal act beyond the unwanted touching.

I advised Rosa of her options, including the possibility of medical examination and evidence collection through a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE). However, she declined to pursue these services, and no evidence collection was conducted. I documented this decision in the report.

Given the circumstances and the information provided, I concluded that this incident did not meet the threshold for criminal charges under the current statute. The interaction appeared to be an inappropriate contact without compulsion or injury. Therefore, I classified the case as administrative in nature. I informed Rosa of this determination and provided her with resources for support and counseling should she choose to seek them.

Throughout the investigation, Officer Li assisted with securing the scene and ensuring the safety of all parties involved. No further witnesses or evidence were identified at the location. The stairwell and surrounding areas were checked for any physical evidence or surveillance footage, but none was found.

At 18:09:36, we cleared the scene, having completed all necessary documentation and provided the reporting party with appropriate information and referrals. The case was logged under CAD# 25-242222 for administrative follow-up.

In summary, the incident involved unwanted touching without physical injury or restraint. The reporting party declined medical examination and evidence collection. Based on the information gathered, no criminal charges were pursued, and the matter was handled administratively.

The weather was clear with a temperature of 76°F. Our time on scene lasted from 10:16:21 to 11:06:49.

Upon arrival, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as Maya. During the initial interview, Maya stated, “He touched me in the phone room after I said no.” This allegation prompted a thorough assessment of the circumstances surrounding the incident.

I explained to Maya that for an act to be considered criminal sexual assault under the applicable statutes, there must be evidence of restraint, injury, or force. I clarified that without such elements, the incident may not meet the legal threshold for criminal charges. Maya was informed of her rights and the procedures available to her, including the option to provide additional evidence such as badge camera footage, CCTV recordings, email headers, or witness statements. However, she declined to provide or pursue these options, citing that the “intent [was] not visible,” indicating her belief that the perpetrator’s intent could not be clearly established.

I inquired about her willingness to undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination or to access victim resources, but Maya declined both offers. I ensured she was aware of available support services should she reconsider in the future.

Based on the information provided, I summarized the situation as follows: there was no indication of force or injury, and there appeared to be a prior rapport between Maya and the individual involved. Given these factors, the essential elements required to classify the incident as a criminal sexual assault were lacking.

Throughout the interview, Officer Alvarado assisted with note-taking and maintaining a supportive environment for Maya. We ensured that all statements were documented accurately and that Maya’s concerns were addressed with professionalism and sensitivity.

At 11:06:49, having completed the interview and assessment, we cleared the scene. The case was documented under CAD# 25-242233. No further investigative action was taken at this time due to the absence of criminal elements. Maya was advised to contact the department should she wish to provide additional information or if circumstances change.

On November 24, 2025, at approximately 16:04 hours, I, Officer Ortega (#2688), responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at City Beach, specifically near Dune Path 3 Bench. The weather was breezy with a temperature of 79°F. Upon arrival, I was accompanied by Officer Wynn (#3011), who served as secondary officer on scene. The call was logged under CAD# 25-242244.

At the scene, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as Aria, who alleged that a sexual assault had occurred. Aria stated, “We kissed; he touched me after I said stop.” I carefully documented her statement and began assessing the situation to determine if the elements of a sexual assault were present.

During my initial interview, I explained to Aria that prior consent to intimate contact can complicate the determination of whether subsequent touching constitutes a criminal act unless there is evidence of force or coercion. I asked her to clarify the circumstances surrounding the incident, including whether any physical restraint or injuries had occurred.

Aria confirmed that there were no injuries sustained and that she was not physically restrained at any point. I conducted a thorough visual inspection for any signs of trauma or injury and found none. Given the absence of physical evidence and the lack of any indication of force or compulsion, I concluded that the essential elements required to classify the incident as a criminal sexual assault were not present.

I also inquired whether Aria wished to undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination to collect forensic evidence. She declined, and no forensic evidence was collected at the scene. I documented this decision in the report.

In summary, the interaction involved prior intimacy between the parties, and while Aria expressed discomfort with the touching after she said stop, there was no evidence of force, restraint, or injury. The knowledge and intent behind the contact were ambiguous, and no criminal elements were established based on the information and evidence available.

The entire incident was recorded on body-worn cameras, with my primary footage capturing the interaction from 16:04:33 to 16:59:11. After completing the interview and assessment, I cleared the scene at 16:59 hours.

No further action was taken at this time, but Aria was provided with information on support services and advised to contact law enforcement should she wish to pursue the matter further.

On November 25, 2025, at approximately 18:10 hours, I, Officer Ebner (#2339), along with Officer Fox (#2577), responded to a sexual assault report at 60 Orchard Co-Op, Room 3B. The weather was cloudy with a temperature of 70°F. Our time on scene was from 18:10:37 to 19:02:04.

Upon arrival, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as ""Piper,"" who alleged that an unwanted sexual advance had occurred. Specifically, Piper stated that there was unwanted contact beneath her shirt after she had clearly communicated that she did not want to engage in sexual activity. I carefully documented her account and assessed the circumstances surrounding the claim.

During the interview, I explained to Piper the legal standards regarding consent. I stated, “Invitation implies consent; revocation must be unmistakable,” to clarify that while initial consent may have been given, it must be clearly and unequivocally withdrawn to be legally recognized. Piper maintained that she had explicitly communicated her refusal prior to the unwanted contact.

I then evaluated the presence of any physical resistance or injury that might corroborate the allegation. According to the evidence and my observations, there was no indication of physical resistance or injury. The absence of such signs is relevant in assessing the credibility and nature of the claim.

Additionally, I noted that there was no corroborating evidence or a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination conducted to support the report. The lack of forensic evidence or medical evaluation limited the ability to substantiate the claim further.

After reviewing all available information, including Piper’s statement, the absence of physical injury, and the lack of corroboration, I summarized the situation as follows: there was no evidence of force or injury, the knowledge of consent was doubtful, and the case was deemed unfounded based on the current facts.

Throughout the investigation, Officer Fox assisted in securing the scene and ensuring the safety and comfort of the reporting party. No further action was taken at the scene, and the case was closed at 19:02 hours.

In conclusion, the report of unwanted under-shirt contact after refusal of sexual activity was thoroughly investigated. However, due to the absence of physical evidence, injury, or corroboration, and the ambiguous nature of consent revocation, the allegation was classified as unfounded. All findings and statements were documented in accordance with department protocol.

On November 25, 2025, at approximately 13:10 hours, I, Officer Hwang (#2984), along with Officer Cutter (#3110), responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at the City Library, specifically in Study Room 2C. The weather was overcast with a temperature of 69°F. Our dispatch number for this incident was CAD# 25-242266.

Upon arrival at 13:12:02, I made contact with the reporting party, who identified herself as Elise. She appeared visibly distressed but cooperative. Elise provided a detailed account of the incident, which I documented thoroughly. According to her statement, the event occurred within the private confines of Study Room 2C, involving peers known to her. She emphasized that there was no use of force or physical compulsion during the encounter.

During the interview, I noted that Elise described the interaction as ambiguous in terms of consent and knowledge. She did not report any physical injury or overt coercion. Based on her description, the incident appeared to fall outside the statute of limitations for prosecutable sexual assault under current state law. I made this observation clear during the conversation to manage expectations regarding potential legal outcomes.

At 13:12:29, we decided to omit evidence collection and forensic examination due to the nature of the report and the absence of physical injury or compulsion. This decision was made in consultation with Officer Cutter and in accordance with department protocols for cases where the statute of limitations has expired and no physical evidence is present.

Throughout the interview, Elise reiterated her account consistently, and I ensured that her statements were recorded accurately. I summarized the key points of the report at 13:12:35, noting the lack of compulsion or injury and the ambiguous nature of consent as described by Elise.

We remained on scene until 14:03:15 to complete all necessary documentation and to provide Elise with information on available support services, including counseling and victim advocacy resources. I advised her of her rights and the options for follow-up should she choose to pursue them in the future.

No further action was taken at the scene, and the case was closed pending any additional information. All procedures were conducted in accordance with department guidelines and with sensitivity to the victim’s well-being.

On November 26, 2025, at approximately 17:24 hours, I, Sergeant Salazar (#2081), along with Officer Keane (#3775), responded to a call regarding a reported sexual assault at City Market, specifically in Service Hall E. The weather was hot, around 90°F, and the area was notably crowded at the time of our arrival.

Upon arrival at 17:24:47, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as Kara. She stated that an individual had grabbed her near the mop sink area. Kara clearly expressed that she said ""No"" to the unwanted contact. I noted the location was within a busy, public space, which was consistent with the crowded environment described.

I conducted an initial assessment of the situation. Kara did not exhibit any visible injuries, and she did not indicate any physical harm resulting from the incident. Given the circumstances and the absence of injury, I classified the situation as a potential harassment case rather than an aggravated assault. I informed Kara that the incident would be handled with sensitivity and that further investigation would be conducted as appropriate.

At 17:25:13, I determined that there was no immediate corroboration of the claim available at the scene. I advised that a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) evaluation would be necessary to provide a thorough medical and forensic examination, should Kara choose to pursue that option. I explained the importance of this step for evidence collection and her well-being.

By 17:25:20, after reviewing the information and considering the circumstances, I summarized the incident as involving no force or injury. The mens rea, or the intent behind the alleged action, was ambiguous based on the available information. This ambiguity made it difficult to definitively classify the event as a criminal sexual assault without further evidence or testimony.

Throughout the interaction, I maintained a professional and supportive demeanor, ensuring Kara felt heard and respected. I provided her with information on available resources, including counseling and victim support services, and advised her on the next steps should she decide to file a formal complaint or seek further assistance.

We remained on scene until 18:15:33, during which time we documented the incident thoroughly and ensured that all procedural protocols were followed. No additional witnesses came forward, and no further evidence was collected at the scene.

In conclusion, the incident was recorded as a sexual harassment report with no physical injury or clear evidence of criminal intent. The case remains open pending any further information or follow-up from the victim or witnesses.
