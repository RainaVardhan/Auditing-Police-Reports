responded to a report of a sexual assault at a local restaurant, specifically in the staff locker corridor. The weather was cloudy with a temperature of 69°F. Upon arrival, I made contact with the reporting party, identified as Camila, who stated that after the restaurant had closed, a male coworker touched her chest without consent. Camila reported that she immediately said “No” and left the area.\n","\n","During the interview, I noted that the kitchen corridors in the establishment are typically crowded during operating hours, and brief physical contact can sometimes be incidental due to the confined space. I asked Camila if there was any physical restraint or injury resulting from the incident. She confirmed that there were no marks or injuries and that she did not shout or call out during the encounter.\n","\n","I further inquired about the context and whether there might have been any misunderstanding or lack of awareness on the part of the alleged offender. Camila mentioned that coworkers often tease each other, suggesting the possibility that the male employee may not have been fully aware of the inappropriateness of his actions.\n","\n","There was no CCTV footage available from the corridor where the incident occurred, nor were there any witnesses present to corroborate the report. Camila did not have any photographic evidence, and no Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) or other medical resources were utilized or requested.\n","\n","Based on the information gathered, there was no indication of compulsion, physical injury, or incapacitation. The intent behind the contact was ambiguous, and the incident appeared to be more of an administrative concern rather than a criminal matter. I advised Camila of her options and the procedures for reporting any future incidents. The case was documented accordingly.\n","\n","At 22:55 hours, I cleared the scene with no further action taken at that time. Officer Fox (#2577) was present as secondary during the response and assisted as needed.\n","\n","Report completed by Officer Ebner (#2339).\n"]}],"source":["#preview output so we dont have to download every time\n","def preview_outputs(path_glob=f\"{OUTPUT_PREFIX}*.xlsx\", max_reports=1): #max only one report for now\n","    import glob\n","    files = sorted(glob.glob(path_glob))\n","    if not files:\n","        print(\"No batch files found yet.

Weather conditions were clear and sunny with a temperature of 82\\u00b0F. Upon arrival, officers found building security personnel present at the scene.\\n\\nAt 17:22:18, officers located the complainant, identified as Rosa, a female in her mid-30s, seated on a stair step within the stairwell. Rosa was clutching her phone and appeared visibly distressed. Officer Li introduced himself and Officer Gomez, and offered Rosa the option to relocate to a more private setting for the interview. Rosa expressed a preference to move to an empty conference room on the third floor of the building, which was arranged promptly.\\n\\nAt 17:23:12, Officer Li obtained Rosa\\u2019s consent to record the interview and explained the purpose of the recording. The interview commenced with an open-ended prompt allowing Rosa to provide a free narrative of the incident. Rosa stated that she works on the fourth floor and that the suspect cornered her between the third and fourth floors. She reported that the suspect placed his hand on her, to which she responded by saying \\u201cstop.\\u201d\\n\\nOfficer Li mirrored Rosa\\u2019s language and encouraged her to describe the sequence of events in detail without interruption. Rosa elaborated that prior interactions with the suspect had been cordial but clarified that there was no romantic relationship between them. She emphasized that she clearly said \\u201cstop\\u201d and \\u201cI have to go back to work\\u201d during the encounter.\\n\\nOfficer Gomez documented exact quotes attributed to the suspect, including the statement: \\u201cDon\\u2019t act like you don\\u2019t want it.\\u201d To clarify the spatial details of the incident, officers asked Rosa to indicate the specific step and wall where the contact occurred. Rosa pointed out the location, and with her consent, officers photographed the area, including measurements of the handrail height to provide context.\\n\\nA physical examination of Rosa revealed redness on her upper arm consistent with the described contact. Photographs of the injury were taken with a scale for evidentiary purposes. Officers requested building security to preserve access logs and surveillance footage from 16:45 to 17:10 hours covering Stairwell B and adjacent corridors. An email was sent to property management referencing the incident number to ensure preservation of relevant video evidence.\\n\\nOfficers identified two witnesses: a coworker named Dev, who observed Rosa returning to work visibly upset, and an HR representative named Ally, who had been notified of the incident. Rosa consented to Ally\\u2019s presence during the interview for support, but officers maintained an independent record of the statements.\\n\\nLanguage preference was confirmed, with Rosa choosing to conduct the interview in English despite fluency in Spanish. Officer Li offered Rosa a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination, explaining the options of immediate, delayed, or no exam, and the ability to change her decision later. The option to collect clothing as evidence was discussed, and paper bags were provided should Rosa choose to preserve any items. Rosa elected to delay the exam and was advised to avoid washing the affected area if comfortable, with instructions on the appropriate timeline for evidence collection.\\n\\nDigital evidence was addressed when Rosa presented a text message from the suspect sent at 17:01 stating, \\u201cWe good?\\u201d Officers captured a screenshot including time metadata and discussed the possibility of a forensic download of Rosa\\u2019s phone data via consent or warrant at a later time.\\n\\nThe suspect was not present at the scene, and officers refrained from attempting contact without prior coordination to preserve the integrity of the investigation. Rosa was offered emotional support services and accepted a hotline advocate call, which was conducted by phone during the interview.\\n\\nOpen-ended questioning continued, with Rosa describing how she managed to escape the encounter by stepping down the stairs, verbally saying \\u201cNo,\\u201d and exiting through the door on the third floor. With Rosa\\u2019s consent, officers conducted a walk-through of the scene, documenting her path and confirming that the door latch functioned normally with no mechanical issues. Environmental conditions were noted as favorable, with good lighting and surveillance cameras likely capturing entry and exit points.\\n\\nRosa requested assistance in informing her supervisor about the incident. Officers provided her with a brief statement template that allowed her to communicate without disclosing details she was not ready to share. Safety planning for the workplace was discussed, including options for schedule changes, security escorts, and information on protective orders.\\n\\nOfficers clarified the next steps, explaining that a formal recorded interview could be scheduled at Rosa\\u2019s convenience, and that the current account was preliminary. They emphasized that Rosa\\u2019s participation level was entirely her choice. A short break was taken during which water was provided.\\n\\nUpon resuming, Rosa recalled the suspect\\u2019s appearance, describing him as wearing a gray quarter-zip sweater and an identification badge with a red lanyard. She provided an approximate height estimate. Officer Li requested that HR retain badge activity logs and sent a preservation letter to that effect.\\n\\nThroughout the interview, officers avoided leading questions and character judgments, focusing strictly on factual details including who, what, when, where, how, and exact quotes from Rosa. When Rosa inquired about no-contact options, officers advised her on internal HR procedures and criminal remedies, providing her with a form containing information on temporary protective orders.\\n\\nThe interview concluded with a review and summary of Rosa\\u2019s statements, which she confirmed as accurate. She signed a statement acknowledging that her participation was voluntary. At 17:51 hours, officers cleared the scene to begin a follow-up canvass of surveillance cameras and other investigative actions.\\n\\nThe entire on-scene investigation lasted until 18:19 hours, concluding with officers securing all collected evidence and preparing for subsequent investigative steps.\\n\\nThis report documents the initial response, victim interview, evidence preservation, and support measures provided in relation to the sexual assault\",\n          \"CASE_ID: 17\\n\\nOn September 9, 2025, at approximately 10:19 hours, Officers Li (#2631) and Gomez (#2740) responded to a report of a sexual assault at 500 Market Street, Office Suite 610, Quiet Room. The weather was overcast with a temperature of 68\\u00b0F. The call was logged under CAD# 25-240162. Upon arrival, officers met with the reporting party, identified here as \\u201cMaya,\\u201d who was accompanied by a Human Resources (HR) representative at her request.\\n\\nThe officers began by clarifying the independent criminal investigation process with Maya to ensure she understood her rights and the procedures that would follow. At 10:20:11, Maya provided consent to have the interview recorded, with the understanding that she retained the right to pause or stop the recording at any time.\\n\\nMaya then gave a free narrative account of the incident. She described an encounter in the phone room where an individual engaged in unwanted physical contact. Maya stated that she explicitly said, \\u201cNo, this is not okay,\\u201d to the individual, who nonetheless persisted briefly before she exited the area. The officers took care to avoid any character judgments during the interview and focused on clarifying the sequence of events, direct quotes, and the physical positions of both parties involved.\\n\\nAt 10:22:19, officers documented evidence related to the incident. This included badge logs and surveillance footage from a camera located in the corridor outside the Quiet Room. A formal preservation request was sent to ensure that all relevant digital and physical evidence would be retained for investigative purposes.\\n\\nMaya was informed about the option to undergo a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) examination. She declined the examination but accepted an informational packet detailing the procedure and available resources should she choose to pursue it later.\\n\\nAt 10:23:28, officers secured a digital piece of evidence: an email from the suspect containing the statement, \\u201cApologies if I made you uncomfortable.\\u201d This email was saved, photographed, and the header information preserved to maintain the integrity of the evidence. The department\\u2019s Information Technology unit was tasked with archiving the email under a retention hold to prevent deletion or alteration.\\n\\nOfficers also identified a potential witness, a coworker who reportedly heard the door to the Quiet Room close quickly during the time of the incident. Contact information for this witness was obtained for follow-up.\\n\\nRegarding Maya\\u2019s safety and workplace accommodations, the HR representative arranged a schedule change to minimize contact between Maya and the suspect. Officers provided Maya with information about protection orders and explained the process should she decide to pursue one.\\n\\nAt 10:26:07, officers read back a summary of the interview and evidence collected to Maya, who confirmed the accuracy of the information. The interview and evidence collection concluded at 11:12:33.\\n\\nSummary:\\n\\nOn September 9, 2025, Officers Li and Gomez responded to a sexual assault report at 500 Market Street, Office Suite 610. The reporting party, Maya, described an incident involving unwanted touching by a coworker in the phone room. Maya clearly communicated her non-consent during the encounter, which the suspect briefly disregarded. Evidence collected included badge logs, corridor surveillance footage, and a digital email apology from the suspect. Maya declined a SANE exam but received information about the procedure. A witness who heard the door close quickly was identified, and workplace accommodations were arranged by HR to ensure Maya\\u2019s safety. Officers provided information on protection orders. The investigation is ongoing, with evidence preserved and follow-up planned.\\n\\nAll procedures were conducted in accordance with department protocols, ensuring the victim\\u2019s rights and safety were prioritized throughout the process.\",\n          \"CASE_ID: 1\\n\\nOn April 6, 2025, at approximately 02:06 hours, Officers P.O. Patel (#5123) and P.O. Nguyen (#4419) responded to a reported sexual assault at the rear parking lot of 1190 N. Cedar Avenue, City of Foxridge. The weather conditions at the time were light rain with a temperature of 47\\u00b0F. The call was dispatched under CAD# 25-147210. Upon arrival, officers initiated contact with the victim, a female adult later identified as Ari [last name withheld], who was seated on the curb near a gray four-door sedan with the rear passenger door slightly ajar. Ari was accompanied by a friend, identified as Kira [last name withheld], who was standing nearby and providing support.\\n\\nOfficers immediately informed Ari that their body-worn cameras were recording and obtained her consent to proceed with the interview on scene. Ari confirmed her willingness to speak and provided her date of birth and phone number. Kira also identified herself and confirmed her presence as a witness and support person.\\n\\nAri reported that the suspect, identified by first name as Luis, a coworker, had forcibly placed her in the backseat of the gray sedan against her will. She stated, \\u201cHe put me in the backseat and I said \\u2018Stop\\u2019\\u201d and \\u201cI told him no.\\u201d Ari described the suspect as a Hispanic male, mid-30s, approximately 5\\u201910\\u201d with a medium build, wearing a navy jacket, jeans, and a black cap. She last saw Luis depart the parking lot in a dark SUV at approximately 01:55 hours, which was not her vehicle.\\n\\nDuring the interview, Ari appeared alert and oriented with steady breathing. No visible external injuries were noted on her face or forearms, which were covered by a rain jacket. However, Ari reported soreness in her inner thighs. Kira stated that she had received a phone call from Ari at 01:58 hours, during which Ari was crying and said, \\u201cHe won\\u2019t get out of the car,\\u201d before the call dropped. Kira then called 911 at 02:01 hours, which was confirmed by dispatch at 02:01:12.\\n\\nAri provided a detailed sequence of events leading up to the incident. She and Luis had left a bar around 01:35 hours. Luis offered to walk her to her car. Upon arrival at the parking lot, Luis asked to sit in the vehicle. Ari stated she needed to leave, but Luis opened the back door and nudged her inside despite her repeated verbal refusals, saying \\u201cstop\\u201d and \\u201cno\\u201d multiple times. Ari attempted to push him away and told him, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want this,\\u201d when he pushed her down. She also stated, \\u201cHe held my wrists.\\u201d \\n\\nOfficers requested Emergency Medical Services (EMS) for a medical evaluation and Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam. Ari consented to visual documentation of the vehicle\\u2019s interior prior to EMS arrival. Officer Patel conducted a thorough visual inspection of the gray sedan without disturbing any items. The vehicle\\u2019s rear passenger door was ajar, and the back seat fabric was torn at the center seam, approximately four inches in length. A tissue was observed on the floorboard, and a single condom wrapper was found near the rear passenger footwell. The license plate was partially obscured by mud, but a temporary paper permit was visible inside the rear window. The vehicle\\u2019s ownership was unknown at the time.\\n\\nPhotographs were taken of the rear passenger door, back seat area, floorboard, and condom wrapper with Ari\\u2019s consent. Officer Patel noted that the weather conditions, specifically the light rain, could impact the preservation of exterior evidence; therefore, no evidence collection was performed on scene. Clothing worn by Ari was documented as black leggings and a gray hoodie. Ari reported she had not showered since the incident.\\n\\nOfficer Patel canvassed the immediate area, including a laundromat located to the east side of the parking lot. The laundromat had a CCTV dome camera aimed toward a shared alley. Officer Patel spoke with the night attendant through a locked door and requested footage covering the time frame from 01:30 to 02:10 hours. The attendant agreed to contact the manager at 07:00 hours to facilitate the request.\\n\\nKira confirmed that Ari had called her crying during the incident, stating that Luis \\u201cwon\\u2019t get out of the car.\\u201d Officer Nguyen offered Ari the assistance of a victim advocate, which Ari accepted. EMS arrived on scene at 02:11 hours, with the lead paramedic introducing herself as Renee. Renee explained the medical and forensic options available, and Ari elected to proceed with the SANE exam.\\n\\nAri consented to leave the vehicle in place, with ownership verification to be handled by Records. Officer Patel radioed Records to check the license plate and temporary permit. Records returned that the temporary permit was tied to dealership lot inventory and was not registered to the victim.\\n\\nAri provided text messages exchanged with Luis earlier that evening, including one timestamped at 01:31 hours stating, \\u201cI can walk you.\\u201d Screenshots of these messages were captured with Ari\\u2019s consent. Officer Nguyen provided Ari with a Victim Options pamphlet, explaining the evidence collection window and clothing preservation guidance.\\n\\nEMS prepared Ari and Kira for transport to Foxridge General Hospital for the SANE exam. Ari consented to the release of the sexual assault kit to law enforcement following the exam. Officer Patel summarized the incident for the body-worn camera, confirming victim identification, direct quotes, vehicle interior photographs, and the identification of a CCTV lead. No evidence collection was performed on scene pending the SANE exam.\\n\\nAt 02:25 hours, officers arrived at Foxridge General Hospital\\u2019s Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) unit. Officers remained outside the exam room during the procedure.

Camila reported that she immediately said “No” and left the area.\n","\n","During the interview, I noted that the kitchen corridors in the establishment are typically crowded during operating hours, and brief physical contact can sometimes be incidental due to the confined space.

The weather was cloudy with a temperature of 70°F. Upon arrival, we made contact with the complainant, identified as Lena, who provided an account of the incident.\n","\n","Lena stated that after consuming drinks at the hotel bar, an individual placed his hand inside her dress without her consent. She clearly told him \"No\" and indicated her desire for him to leave by pointing toward the door. According to her statement, the individual attempted the same action once more despite her refusal.\n","\n","During the initial assessment, I considered the context of the interaction, noting that the complainant and the subject had been flirting at the bar prior to the incident. I explained that while flirtation can suggest mutual interest, a single verbal refusal, such as \"No,\" might sometimes be interpreted as ambiguous or mixed messaging in social situations. However, I emphasized that for an incident to meet the threshold of sexual assault under the law, there must be evidence of force, restraint, or injury.\n","\n","I inquired about any physical injuries or signs of struggle, but Lena reported none. There were no visible injuries or indications of physical coercion. Additionally, no medical examination by a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) was conducted or requested at the time of our investigation. I also noted that keycard logs, hallway surveillance footage, and potential witnesses were not reviewed or considered during the initial report.\n","\n","Based on the information gathered, including the absence of force, restraint, injury, or corroborating evidence, I concluded that the incident did not meet the prosecutorial standards for sexual assault. The complainant’s description suggested unwanted contact, but without additional elements such as physical coercion or injury, the case was classified as non-prosecutable.\n","\n","Throughout the interaction, I maintained a professional and empathetic demeanor, ensuring Lena was informed of her options and resources, although no immediate referrals to support services were made. The entire response and investigation at the scene lasted until approximately 21:57 hours, at which point we cleared the location.\n","\n","In summary, the incident involved unwanted physical contact following a social interaction characterized by mutual flirtation.

Cedar Ave., City of Foxridge. The weather was light rain with a temperature of 47°F. Upon arrival, we observed a gray four-door sedan parked with the rear passenger door slightly ajar. A female adult, later identified as Ari [last name withheld], was seated on the curb near the vehicle, wrapped in a blanket provided by her friend, Kira [last name withheld], who stood nearby.\n","\n","I introduced myself and informed Ari that we were recording on our body cameras and asked for her consent to speak on scene, which she granted. Ari appeared alert and oriented, with steady breathing and no visible external injuries on her face or forearms. She reported soreness in her inner thighs. Kira confirmed she had called 911 at 02:01 after receiving a distressed phone call from Ari at 01:58.\n","\n","Ari stated that the suspect, identified as Luis, a coworker, had put her in the backseat of the vehicle against her will. She described how Luis had offered to walk her to her car after leaving a bar around 01:35. Upon arrival at the parking lot, Luis asked to sit in the car, but Ari expressed her desire to leave. Luis then opened the back door and nudged her inside despite her repeated verbal refusals, saying “stop” and “no.” Ari attempted to push him away, and she said, “He held my wrists.” She described Luis as a Hispanic male in his mid-30s, approximately 5’10” with a medium build, wearing a navy jacket, jeans, and a black cap. Luis was last seen leaving the lot in a dark SUV around 01:55.\n","\n","We requested EMS for a medical evaluation and a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) exam at the hospital. Ari consented to officers photographing the interior of the vehicle prior to EMS arrival. Upon inspection, the gray sedan’s back seat fabric was torn approximately four inches at the center seam, and tissue paper was found on the floorboard. A condom wrapper was located near the rear passenger footwell. The vehicle’s license plate was partially obscured by mud, and a temporary paper permit was visible inside the rear window. The permit was later confirmed to be tied to dealership inventory and not registered to Ari.\n","\n","I canvassed the area and spoke with the night attendant at a nearby laundromat, who agreed to request CCTV footage covering the time frame from 01:30 to 02:10. The footage could potentially capture Luis’s departure in the dark SUV.\n","\n","At 02:11, EMS arrived, and the lead paramedic, Renee, explained the medical and forensic options to Ari, who elected to proceed with the SANE exam. Ari consented to leave the vehicle in place and to the release of the sexual assault kit to law enforcement after the exam.\n","\n","At the hospital, the sexual assault kit and clothing items (black leggings, gray hoodie, and underwear) were sealed and received by Officer Nguyen at 02:47. The evidence was logged into the CAD and evidence module accordingly. An advocate arrived at 02:58 to provide support to Ari.\n","\n","We cleared the hospital at 03:03, concluding our involvement. The victim’s identity was verified, direct quotes were documented, and photographic evidence of the vehicle interior was collected with consent.
